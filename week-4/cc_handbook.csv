"Mitigating climate changeMitigating climate change and its impacts lies at the heart of the Convention’sobjective. Stabilizing  GHG  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  at  a  level  thatwould prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,which  is  the  ultimate  objective  ofthe  Convention  (see  chapter  1), can  beachieved  in  two  ways. The  first  is  by  limiting  or, as  appropriate, reducinganthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and the second by preserving or, asappropriate, enhancing sinks and reservoirs of GHGs.",0
"the  Convention, Article  1  defines  a  source as  “anyFor  the  purposes  ofprocess  or  activity  which  releases  a  greenhouse  gas, an  aerosol  or  aprecursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere”; a sink as “any process,activity  or  mechanism  which  removes  a  greenhouse  gas, an  aerosol  or  aprecursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere” and a reservoir as “acomponent or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gasor a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored”. Climate system is defined asthe  totality  of the  atmosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere  and  biosphere  andtheir  interactions, thus  including  not  only  the  atmosphere, but  also  earth,water, and living organisms.",0
"This chapter discusses the provisions and activities related to mitigation underthe climate change process. Section 11.A addresses commitments relevant toall Parties, while section 11.B addresses those that are relevant specifically toAnnex  I  Parties; section  11.C  refers  to  activities  by  non-Annex  I  Parties  inconnection with their national communications; and section 11.D reviews otherareas. Some aspects of the Kyoto Protocol that are closely related to the topicsdiscussed  in  this  chapter  are  addressed  in  Box  11.2  (Kyoto  flexibilitymechanisms), Box 11.3 (LULUCF) and Box 11.4 (core elements of the KyotoProtocol). Box 11.5 addresses the so-called Brazilian proposal for distributingemission targets on the basis of historical contributions to climate change.",0
"11.A. Measures to mitigate climate change: all Parties11.A.1. General policy aspects of mitigationArticle  3.3  stipulates  that  Parties  should  take  precautionary  measures  toanticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate itsadverse effects. In order to ensure global benefits at the least possible cost, suchpolicies  and  measures  should  take  into  account  different  socio-economiccontexts, be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs ofGHGs and adaptation (see chapter 12) and comprise all economic sectors. Inaddition, they may be carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.",0
The Convention addresses the full range of GHGs with the exception of thosewhich  are  already  controlled  by  the  Montreal  Protocol  on  Substances  thatDeplete the Ozone Layer (see chapter 4 on the Montreal Protocol and chapter18 on relevant gases).,0
General  commitments  of Parties  to  mitigate  climate  change  are  included  inArticle 4.1 (for all Parties) and more specific commitments are in Article 4.2 (forAnnex I Parties). The Convention draws attention to the different needs and,0

"capacities of Parties in the implementation of the commitments contained inArticle 4.1. The article is premised on the need to take into account Parties’“common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  their  specific  national  andregional  development  priorities, objectives  and  circumstances”. Article  4.2(a)also  calls  for  differentiation  among  the  Annex  I  Parties, stating  that  accountshould  be  taken  of “the  differences  in  these  Parties’ starting  points  andapproaches, economic  structures  and  resource  bases, the  need  to  maintainstrong  and  sustainable  economic  growth, available  technologies  and  otherindividual circumstances”.",0
"Article 4.1(b) calls on all Parties to “formulate, implement, publish and regularlyupdate  national  and, where  appropriate, regional  programmes  containingmeasures to mitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissionsby sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by theMontreal Protocol”.",0
"On sinks and reservoirs, Article 4.1(d) calls on Parties to “promote sustainablemanagement, and  promote  and  cooperate  in  the  conservation  andenhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gasesnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceansas well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems”.",0
"to  the  extent  feasible,",0
"Article  4.1(f)  requires  Parties  to  “take  climate  change  considerations  intoaccount,in  their  relevant  social, economic  andenvironmental  policies  and  actions”. It  also  calls  on  Parties  to  “employappropriate  methods,formulated  anddetermined nationally”, with a view to minimizing adverse effects that projectsor  measures  undertaken  in  the  context  of mitigation  could  have  “on  theeconomy, on public health or on the quality of the environment”.",0
"for  example  impact  assessments,",0
"Article  4.1(h)  requires  Parties  to  promote  and  cooperate  in  the  full, open  andprompt exchange of relevant scientific, technological, technical, socio-economicand legal information related to the climate system and climate change, and tothe economic and social consequences of various response strategies.",0
Article 4.7 requires that to the extent to which developing country Parties willeffectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend onthe  effective  implementation  by  developed  country  Parties  oftheircommitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transferoftechnology  and  will  take  fully  into  account  that  economic  and  socialdevelopment and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities ofthe developing country Parties.,0

The work on these issueswas also endorsed by COP 9 in 2003, which asked the SBSTA to report on it toCOP 11, and to focus on exchanging information among Parties on practicalways of helping implement the Convention (decision 10/CP.9).",0
"SBSTA 19 noted that relevant themes for consideration under the two newagenda  items  included: sustainable  development, opportunities  andsolutions, and vulnerability and risk, and mandated workshops on each itemduring SBSTA 20. SBSTA 20 identified two topics for further considerationunder mitigation:",0
"technology innovation, deployment and diffusion, including identificationand removal of barriers; andpractical opportunities and solutions that contribute to sustainabledevelopment.",0
"SBSTA 21, SBSTA 22 and SBSTA 23 continued to consider these topics. SBSTA23  asked  the  secretariat  to  organize  workshops  at  its  next  sessions, on  thefollowing themes:",0
"agriculture, forestry and rural development (in-session, SBSTA 24 (May2006));urban planning and development, including transportation (in-session,SBSTA 25 (November 2006));energy efficiency, including industry, and residential and commercial end-use (pre-session, SBSTA 26 (May 2007));power generation, including clean fossil fuels and renewable energy (pre-session, SBSTA 26);non-CO2 emissions, including methane recovery and use (in-session,SBSTA 27 (December 2007)).",0
Aspects to be considered at each workshop include:,0

Mitigation and related communication commitmentsSpecific commitments by Annex I Parties to mitigate climate change are laid downin Article 4.2. According to Article 4.2(a), each Annex I Party “shall adopt nationalpolicies and take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change, bylimiting  its  anthropogenic  emissions  of greenhouse  gases  and  protecting  andenhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs”. The article further states that“the return by the end of the present decade [i.e. the 1990s] to earlier levels” ofanthropogenic GHG emissions would contribute to modifying longer-term trendsin these emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, an undertakingin which Annex I Parties are called upon to take the lead.",0
"In  addition, Article  4.2(b)  stipulates  that  Annex  I  Parties  “shall  communicatedetailed information” on their policies and measures that aim to return their GHGemissions  individually  or  jointly  to  their  1990  levels. Taken  together, theseprovisions  have  been  interpreted  to  add  up  to  the  non-legally  binding  aim  ofreturning GHG emissions of Annex I Parties to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.",0
The information mentioned in Article 4.2(b) is to be communicated by the Party“within six months of the entry into force of the Convention” and “periodicallythereafter” in  the  context  of the  national  communications  further  defined  byArticle 12 (see chapter 18).,0
"Communications have also to provide estimates of the effects which the policiesand  measures  will  have  on  anthropogenic  GHG  emissions  by  sources  andremovals by sinks. These communications are to be submitted “during the periodreferred to in Article 4, paragraph 2(a)” i.e. by the end of the 1990s.

"Annex I Parties’ third national communications43, noted that Parties had reportedpolicies and measures which covered all the important sources of emissions muchmore  comprehensively  than  previously. There  was  a  clear  indication  of a  shifttowards  implementing  new  climate-specific  policies  and  measures, such  asemissions trading, carbon taxes and green certificate trading. The greatest numberof policies and measures reported were in the energy sector.",0
"As noted in this report, the total aggregated GHG emissions of all reporting AnnexI Parties had “decreased by about 3 per cent from 1990 to 2000”. Thus Annex IParties have jointly attained the aim of Article 4.2 of the Convention – to returntheir 2000 emissions to 1990 levels. Furthermore, in a subsequent publication44,the  sizeable  emission  reduction  of developed  countries, taken  as  a  group, wasconfirmed. Compared to 1990 levels overall GHG emissions of these countrieswere down by 5.9 per cent in 2003. However, the extent to which Annex II Partiessucceeded in reversing an increasing trend in GHG emissions varied widely45.",0
"According to Article 4.2(g), any Party not included in Annex I may at any timenotify the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as the Depositary of theConvention, that  it  intends  to  be  bound  by  Article  4.2(a)  and  4.2(b). Suchnotifications  have  been  made  by  Croatia, the  Czech  Republic, Kazakhstan,Liechtenstein, Monaco, and  Slovakia. With  the  exception  of Kazakhstan,however,the  notifications  have  lost  their  significance  because  the  othercountries have been included in Annex I (see chapter 9).",0

Activities implemented jointly in the pilot phase (AIJ)Referring to the principle of cost-effectiveness, Article 3.3 of the Conventionstates  that  efforts  to  address  climate  change  may  be  carried  outcooperatively  by  interested  Parties. Article  4.2(a)  explains  that  Annex  IParties may implement mitigation policies and measures “jointly with otherParties  and  may  assist  other  Parties  in  contributing  to  the  achievement  ofthe objective of the Convention” and, in particular, the objective of Article4.2(a)  to  modify  longer-term  emission  trends. Furthermore, Article  4.2(d)provides  that  the  COP, at  its  first  session, shall  “take  decisions  regardingcriteria for joint implementation”.",0
"At its first session in 1995, the COP launched a “pilot phase” of AIJ (decision5/CP.1). In this phase, Parties may, on a voluntary basis, implement projectsthat reduce GHG emissions, or enhance removals of GHGs through sinks, inthe territories of other Parties. The reductions in emissions of these projectsmust  exceed  those  which  would  have  occurred  otherwise. However, nocredits (or emissions reduction units; see Box 11.2) may accrue to any Partyfor such reductions or removals. During the pilot phase AIJ may take place“among Annex I Parties and, on a voluntary basis, with non-Annex I Partiesthat so request it”. The aim is to gain experience through learning by doing,for  example  in  establishing  baselines  and  estimating  the  environmentalbenefits of a project.",0
"Decision 5/CP.1 also makes clear that AIJ between Annex I Parties and non-Annex I Parties will not be considered as fulfilling current commitments ofAnnex  I  Parties  under  Article  4.2(b)  (on  limiting  emissions), but  couldcontribute  to  achieving  the  objective  ofthe  Convention  and  to  fulfillingcommitments of Annex II Parties under Article 4.5 (on technology transfer).Furthermore, AIJ  “are  supplemental, and  should  only  be  treated  as  asubsidiary means of achieving the objective of the Convention”. They do notmodify  the  commitments  of each  Party.

A first “comprehensive review”,based on decision 5/CP.1, was completed at COP 5 in 1999 and led to the decisionto continue the pilot phase beyond 2000 (decision 13/CP.5). Parties agreed that,during the continuation of the pilot phase, the issue of geographical imbalanceshould  be  addressed,in  particular  the  lack  of projects  in  Africa  and  SIDS.Decisions to further continue the pilot phase were adopted by COP 7 (decision8/CP.7), COP 8 (decision 14/CP.8) and COP 10 (decision 10/CP.10).",0

The issue was subsequently oftenconsidered under the heading of “good practices” rather than “best practices”,as participants in the workshop had found that the concept of “good practice”was more relevant in the international context, while “best practice” could beto a large extent specific to a particular country51.",0
"Within  the  Marrakesh  Accords, decision  13/CP.7  stipulated  that  cooperationamong Annex I Parties to increase the individual and combined effectivenessof policies and measures should come under the guidance of the SBSTA.

Transparency in reporting on policiesand  measures  in  the  national  communications  of Annex  I  Parties  should  beenhanced  through  criteria  and  quantitative  parameters, as  appropriate.Furthermore, the work should consider issues of methodology, attribution, andnational circumstances. It should also encompass sharing information on howadverse effects of policies and measures – including on developing countries –could be minimized, taking into account information provided by non-Annex IParties.

Review of activities that lead to increased levels of GHGemissionsArticle  4.2  not  only  addresses  policies  and  measures  that  contribute  to  theobjective  ofthe  Convention, but  also  practices  that  may  produce  adverseeffects. Article 4.2(e)(ii) asks each Annex I Party to “identify and periodicallyreview  its  own  policies  and  practices  which  encourage  activities  that  lead  togreater levels of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlledby the Montreal Protocol than would otherwise occur”. This is reflected in theguidelines for national communications of Annex I Parties, which stipulate thatParties should report on action taken to implement commitments under Article4.2(e)(ii) of the Convention, and also provide the rationale for such actions inthe  context  of their  national  communications54. For  example, the  EuropeanUnion, in  its  third  communication, mentions  the  intention  to  phase  out  allsubsidies for fossil fuel production and consumption by 2010, and to undertakean inventory and review of energy subsidies in the Member States, consideringtheir compatibility with climate change objectives.",0

During  theevolution of the Convention process, the term “Land use, land-use change andforestry (LULUCF)” was used to refer to land-use categories that could eitherincrease the removals of GHGs from the atmosphere (e.g. by planting trees ormanaging forests) or reduce emissions (e.g. by curbing deforestation). LULUCFcategories can be a relatively cost-effective way of combating climate change;however, they also have their drawbacks. It may often be difficult to estimateGHG  removals  and  emissions  from  LULUCF. In  addition, GHGs  may  beunintentionally released if a sink is damaged or destroyed, for example througha forest fire or disease.",0

"According to the Kyoto Protocol’s Article 3.3, net changes in GHG emissions and removals from certainland-use change and forestry activities may be used to meet Annex I Parties’ commitments under theProtocol. The eligible activities are afforestation, reforestation and deforestation. If, taken together, theyresult in net removals, the corresponding amount will be added to the amount of GHGs a Party may emit (itsassigned amount). Conversely, if they result in net emissions, the corresponding amount will be subtracted.Removals generate so-called removal units (RMUs) that an Annex I Party can use to help meet itsemissions target; emissions must be offset by greater emission cuts or removals elsewhere. In accordance with Article 3.4 of the Protocol, the Marrakesh Accords (COP 7, 2001) designated a furtherfour eligible activities in the LULUCF sector: forest management, cropland management, grazing landmanagement, and revegetation. Parties may elect which of these additional activities they will use to helpmeet their emissions targets, and the choice is then fixed for the first commitment period.In order to address potential problems associated with LULUCF (such as uncertainties in accounting, or re-release of GHGs) and to ensure credit would not be given for GHG removals that would have occurredanyway, the Marrakesh Accords determined a number of further principles and rules.The principles underscore, for example, the need for sound science and consistent methodologies and theimportance of conserving biodiversity. Naturally occurring removals should be excluded from the system.Any re-release of GHGs from sinks due to land use, land-use change and forestry activities (e.g. forest fires)must be promptly accounted for. Rules for the accounting of emissions and removals in the first commitment period (2008–2012) are set outin decision 13/CMP.1 and in decision 16/CMP.1. They also limit the LULUCF activities eligible under theCDM to afforestation and reforestation. ",0

"11.B.6. Review of the adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and 4.2(b)The issue of the adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and (b) of the Convention arisesfrom  Article  4.2(d), which  was  included  to  address  the  concerns  of somecountries  that  the  Annex  I  Parties’ commitment  to  return  their  GHGemissions to 1990 levels by 2000 was not sufficient. It provides that the COPshall, at its first session, review the adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and (b), takinginto  account  “the  best  available  scientific  information  and  assessment  onclimate  change  and  its  impacts, as  well  as  relevant  technical, social  andeconomic  information. Based  on  this  review, the  Conference  of the  Partiesshall  take  appropriate  action, which  may  include  the  adoption  ofamendments to the commitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) … A secondreview  of subparagraphs  (a)  and  (b)  shall  take  place  not  later  than  31December  1998, and  thereafter  at  regular  intervals  determined  by  theConference of the Parties, until the objective of the Convention is met”.

"The Berlin Mandate began a process to enable the COP “to take appropriateaction  for  the  period  beyond  2000,thecommitments  [of Annex  I  Parties], through  the  adoption  of a  protocol  oranother legal instrument”. The decision reaffirmed the principle of commonbut differentiated responsibilities. It recalled that the largest share of historicaland current global GHG emissions had originated in developed countries, andacknowledged  the  needs  of developing  countries  to  achieve  sustainedeconomic  growth  and  to  eradicate  poverty. The  decision  therefore  providedthat the commitments of the developed Parties included in Annex I should bestrengthened, while no new commitments should be introduced for non-AnnexI Parties. It provided, furthermore, that for Annex I Parties, the process shouldinclude drawing up policies and measures and setting quantified objectives forGHG limitation and reduction within specified time frames. The process was tocover  all  GHGs  not  controlled  by  the  Montreal  Protocol, their  emissions  bysources and removals by sinks, and all relevant sectors. For non-Annex I Parties,the mandate was to reaffirm existing commitments in Article 4.1 (valid for allParties), and to continue working on their implementation.",0

"Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Protocol agreed to be legally bound byspecific commitments on GHG limitation or reduction. The reduction, or limitation,objectives of all of these Parties are listed in Annex B of the Protocol. The reductionsenvisaged are calculated to add up to a total of at least 5 per cent below baselinelevels for the group as a whole, the normal base year being 1990 (with provisions forflexibility for EITs and certain types of gases). The limitation and reduction objectivesare not targeted at a single year, but are calculated as the mean of reductionslogged over a five-year commitment period from 2008 to 2012. The maximumamount of carbon dioxide emissions units (or the equivalent of such units in the caseof other GHGs) that a Party may emit during the commitment period, if it is to fullycomply with its emissions target, is referred to as its assigned amount.The Protocol provides for a comprehensive inclusion of GHGs and sources. ForGHGs, rather than providing values for individual gases, reduction/limitationobjectives refer to a basket of four gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,sulphur hexafluoride) and two groups of gases (hydrofluorocarbons andperfluorocarbons), listed in Annex A of the Protocol. Annex A also contains a list ofsectors and source categories. Removals of GHGs by sinks can be counted towardsa country’s commitments, subject to certain conditions (see Box 11.3).Although each Party listed in Annex B has its individual reduction or limitationcommitment, the Protocol contains a range of provisions for flexibility. Parties mayform a group whose emissions are counted together rather than individually for eachParty, an approach chosen by the European Union. Furthermore, the Protocolintroduces three flexibility mechanisms allowing countries to achieve a proportionof their commitments by earning credits for GHG emissions avoided or GHGremovals achieved in other countries (see Box 11.2). The Protocol also requires theCOP/MOP to approve procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance at its firstsession (see Box 2.3 in chapter 2).The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005. It includes provisions forreviewing commitments so that they can be strengthened over time. It states thatnegotiations on targets for the second commitment period are to start in 2005, bywhich time Annex I Parties which are Parties to the Protocol should have madedemonstrable progress in meeting their commitments. Accordingly, COP/MOP 1decided to initiate a process to consider further commitments by Annex I Parties forthe period beyond 2012. An ad hoc working group of Parties to the Protocol wasestablished to conduct the work and report at each session of the COP/MOP(decision1/CMP.1). The group was requested to complete its task so as to avoid anygap between the first and second commitment period (see chapter 2).",0

Box 11.4: Scientific and methodological assessment of contributions to climatechange: the Brazilian proposal,0
"As part of the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol, the delegation of Brazil proposed, at AGBM 7 (July–August1997), setting differentiated emission reduction targets for Parties according to the impact of their cumulativehistorical emissions, starting from 1840, on the global-average surface temperature58. The proposal suggestedthat reductions towards an overall emission ceiling for all Annex I Parties (30 per cent below 1990 levels by theyear 2020) were to be shared among individual Annex I Parties proportional to their relative share ofresponsibility for climate change. In order to determine this share, the proposal suggested using an agreedsimple climate model.While some aspects of the proposal have been overtaken by the outcome of the Kyoto Protocolnegotiations, there is continued interest in its scientific and methodological aspects. They are centred on thequestion of how, if at all, responsibilities for a global rise in temperature can be calculated from historicalemissions. COP 3 referred the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal to the SBSTA59.The Brazilian government organized a workshop on its proposal in the margins of COP 4 in 1998 and anexpert meeting in its own country in 1999. It presented revised versions of its proposal in 1998 and again in2000. SBSTA 11 (October/November 1999) asked the secretariat to coordinate a review of the revisedproposal by experts. It also invited Parties to submit information.SBSTA 14 (July 2001) took note of the progress achieved on the issue, including the conclusions of anexpert meeting held in May 200160, and encouraged Parties to pursue and support the ongoing researcheffort. It also asked the secretariat to continue its work on the proposal.  In March 2002, the secretariat encouraged research institutions active in the field of climate changemodelling to share information to provide, as a first step, new and comparable results on contributions toclimate change. The secretariat organized a second UNFCCC expert meeting (September 2002 in Bracknell,UK) to assess the preliminary results provided by the research institutions, to encourage cooperationbetween developing and developed country scientists and to identify next steps, including future analysis61.",0

"Article 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol address the reporting and reviewing of information by Annex IParties, as well as national systems and methodologies for preparing GHG inventories. One of the keys tothe success of the Protocol lies in the reliability of data used to assess compliance. The Protocol and theMarrakesh Accords (decisions 15/CMP.1, 22/CMP.1, 23/CMP.1, 24/CMP.1, 25/CMP.1, and 26/CMP.1)therefore include a set of monitoring and compliance procedures to enforce the Protocol’s rules, addressany problems, and avoid any error in calculating emissions data, transactions under the three Kyotomechanisms and activities related to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (see chapter 11.B). The Protocol’s monitoring procedures are based on existing reporting and in-depth review procedures underthe Convention. They also involve additional accounting procedures that are needed to track transactions inthe various units that represent GHG emission reductions, i.e. assigned amount units (AAUs), certifiedemission reductions (CERs) and emission reduction units (ERUs), under the Kyoto mechanisms, and removalunits (RMUs) generated by LULUCF activities.

Thesesystems are to be in place not later than 2007.Article 5.2 states that, where agreed methodologies are not used to estimate emissions and removals,appropriate “adjustments” should be applied.Following recommendations by the COP, COP/MOP 1 adopted the following decisions to guide Annex IParties in implementing and operating their national systems and in applying adjustments: Decision 19/CMP.1: Guidelines for national systems under Article 5, paragraph 1.Decision 20/CMP.1: Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2.Decision 21/CMP.1: Issues relating to adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2.Further information on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 can be found in the secretariat’sworking paper Background documentation on the conservativeness factors for the completion of thetechnical guidance on adjustments at<http://unfccc.int/files/national_reports/accounting_reporting_and_review_under_the_kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/cf_wp_sb22_for_web_final__2may.pdf>.",1
"As a complement, the IPCC issued its Good Practice Guidance and UncertaintyManagement in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories224 (known as the IPCC goodpractice  guidance)  in  2000. Its  aim  is  to  promote  transparency, consistency,comparability, completeness  and  accuracy  ofinventories. It  is  intended  toassist  countries  in  producing  inventories  that  are  neither  overestimates  norunderestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reducedas far as practicable. It includes, for example, decision trees that formalize thechoice of estimation method best suited to national circumstances.",1
"As  the  IPCC  good  practice  guidance  did  not  address  the  LULUCF  sector, afurther  complement  to  the  Guidelines  was  prepared  by  the  IPCC  in  2003,namely  the  Good  practice  Guidance  for  Land  Use, Land-Use  Change  andForestry225 (see Box 18.8).",1
"The current UNFCCC reporting guidelines require Annex I Parties to use theIPCC  Guidelines  and  the  IPCC  good  practice  guidance, including  the  goodpractice guidance for LULUCF. Non-Annex I Parties too should use the IPCCGuidelines and are encouraged to use the good practice guidance (including forLULUCF) in preparing their inventories.",1

Box 18.6: Emissions from bunker fuels used for international aviation and navigation,1
"International bunker fuels, that is, fuels used by air or marine vessels engaged in international transport,constitute an issue for specific consideration on the SBSTA agenda. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelinesand the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, emissions from such fuels are to be calculated as part of the nationalGHG inventories of Parties, but are to be excluded from national totals and reported separately. Theseemissions are not subject to the limitation and reduction commitments of Annex I Parties under theConvention and the Kyoto Protocol. In order to address questions on bunker fuel emissions, theConvention’s bodies cooperate closely with the relevant international organizations, in particular theInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)231 and the International Maritime Organization (IMO)232.In 1995, COP 1 asked the SBSTA to address the allocation and control of emissions from internationalbunker fuels (decision 4/CP.1). It invited relevant international organizations and bodies, including the IPCC,to contribute to this work. SBSTA 4 (December 1996) noted that there were three relevant issues: adequate and consistent inventories; allocation of emissions (i.e. in what way, if at all, these emissions are to be assigned to Parties’ national",1
totals); and,1
" control options.At COP 3 in 1997, Parties adopted the Kyoto Protocol, which in Article 2.2 states that Annex I Parties are topursue limitation or reduction of GHG emissions from aviation and marine bunker fuels, working through theICAO and the IMO, respectively. The COP also urged the SBSTA to further clarify the question of how toinclude these emissions in the overall GHG inventories of Parties (decision 2/CP.3).SBSTA 10 (May–June 1999) considered a Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere233prepared by the IPCC at the request of the ICAO. SBSTA 11 (October–November 1999) affirmed that thequality of reporting by Annex I Parties on bunker fuel emissions needed to be improved, and noted that theissue would be addressed in the forthcoming IPCC good practice guidance, as well as in the new UNFCCCreporting guidelines on annual inventories. COP 5 (1999), by decision 18/CP.5, asked the secretariat todevelop its cooperation with the secretariats of the ICAO and IMO.",1

This included discussion of the definitions by which domestic andinternational fuel uses are separated from each other.SBSTA 18 (June 2003) took note of the status of methodological work by the ICAO and the IMO and endorsedelements for future methodological work235. SBSTA 18 and SBSTA 19 (December 2003), called on the ICAO toprovide data from validated aviation models that would allow a comparison between UNFCCC inventory dataand modelled data for fuel consumption and emissions. SBSTA 19 also agreed to continue consideration of theinclusion of emissions from aviation bunker fuels in the overall GHG inventories of Parties, according to decision2/CP.3, at SBSTA 22 in 2005.In response to a mandate from SBSTA 18, the ICAO and the IMO, in consultation with the UNFCCCsecretariat, each organized an expert meeting in April 2004.

Box 18.7: Explanations of specific terms related to inventories,1
"Activity data: data on the magnitude of human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking placeduring a given period of time. In the energy sector, for example, the annual activity data for fuel combustionsources are the total amounts of fuel burned. Annual activity data for methane emissions from entericfermentation are the total number of animals (livestock population), categorized by species.Emission factor: a coefficient that relates the activity data to the amount of chemical compound that is thesource of later emissions. For example, it may be estimated that X kg of methane is emitted by one cow peryear. Emission factors are often based on a sample of measurement data, averaged to develop arepresentative rate of emission for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions.Key category: a source or sink category that is prioritized within the national inventory system because itsestimate has a significant influence on a country’s total inventory of direct GHGs in terms of the absolutelevel of emissions, the trend in emissions, or both.Indirect greenhouse gases or GHG precursors: compounds which by themselves are not significant asGHGs, but which nevertheless have an effect on the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, as they takepart in physical or chemical processes regulating the production or destruction rates of GHGs.Global warming potential: an index that approximates the warming effect of a unit mass of a GHG over achosen time horizon, relative to that of carbon dioxide (the GWP of carbon dioxide is set as 1). Forexample, the 100-year GWP of a gas expresses the effect on atmospheric warming that it is likely to exertover 100 years relative to that of CO2.Quality assurance: a system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in theprocess of compiling or developing the inventory. These reviews verify that the objectives for quality of datahave been met, ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimates given the state of scientificknowledge and data available, and support the effectiveness of the quality control (QC) programme.Quality control: a system of routine technical activities to measure and control the quality of the inventoryas it is being developed. This includes methods such as checks on the accuracy of data acquisition andcalculations and the use of approved standardized procedures for calculating emissions, measuring,estimating uncertainties, archiving information and reporting.",1
"inventories for all years covered by the report should be estimated usingthe same methodologies to ensure consistency. Where the methodologyhas changed, Parties should recalculate inventories for former years; anda quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plan is required from eachParty (see Box 18.7 for definitions) as well as general and specific qualitycontrol procedures for each source/sink category. These plans andprocedures must be documented.",1

Box 18.8: LULUCF reporting,1
"The LULUCF sector raises a number of specific issues, including uncertainties in estimation, unavailability ofcountry-specific factors or difficulties in estimating stocks of carbon in soils, for the calculation of GHGemissions and removals. Some of these issues are only relevant in the context of LULUCF activities and relatedreporting under the Kyoto Protocol but others are also relevant for preparing inventories under the Convention. The IPCC, at the invitation of COP 7 (decision 11/CP.7), prepared several methodology reports on LULUCF,including Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. This guidance wasincorporated into the reporting tables for LULUCF under the Convention (decision 13/CP.9). In 2005reporting tables for LULUCF were again revised, drawing on the subsequent experience of Parties, andadopted by decision 14/CP.11. In the latest IPCC Guidelines, the LULUCF and Agriculture sectors weremerged into one called “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use” (AFOLU). This sector encompasses bothagriculture issues, such as methane emissions from rice cultivation, and LULUCF issues, such as changes incarbon stocks resulting from shifts in land-use patterns.In addition, the SBSTA is considering the treatment of emissions from harvested wood products (HWP)reported on a voluntary basis by Parties. While the IPCC is currently developing methods to report theseemissions in the context of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the SBSTA is considering issues such as estimationof changes in carbon stocks, the impacts of various accounting approaches and the related implications for,for example, trade and sustainable forest management238. In particular, the need to work on the so-called“accounting approaches” arises whenever the trade of HWP affects the distribution of emissions from theHWP traded between exporters and importers. A technical paper239 and a workshop report240 by thesecretariat further discuss this issue.",1

The annual GHG inventory submissions constitute input to a technical reviewprocess. This has three stages:,1
an initial check;a synthesis and assessment; andindividual reviews of inventories.,1
"A first technical review process was established by COP 5 in 1999, for a two-year trial period covering the inventories submitted in 2000 and 2001 (decision6/CP.5). While  this  period  included  annual  initial  checks  and  an  annualsynthesis  and  assessment  of GHG  inventories  from  all  Annex  I  Parties,individual reviews were only conducted for a limited number of Annex I Partieson a voluntary basis. The trial period was extended at COP 7 in 2001 to includeinventories  submitted  in  2002  (decision  34/CP.7). Since  2003, all  Annex  IParties’inventories  have  been  subject  to  an  individual  technical  review,following  guidelines244 adopted  at  COP  8  (decision  19/CP.8). The  guidelinesbuild  upon  the  earlier  ones  for  the  trial  period245, taking  into  account  theexperience  gathered  since  then. Decision  19/CP.8  stipulated  that  individualreviews  should  be  conducted  until  the  end  ofthe  year  2006, subject  toavailability of resources, and that a report assessing the implementation of theguidelines should be prepared for the SBSTA at its first session in 2006.",1

As ofJune  2006, 132  of 148  non-Annex  I  Parties  had  submitted  their  first  nationalcommunication  and  three  had  submitted  the  second  communication. COP  11decided that non-Annex I Parties should make all efforts to submit their secondand third national communications within four years of the initial disbursement offinancial  resources  (decision  8/CP.11). Furthermore, Parties  might  availthemselves, if necessary, of an extension of up to one year for submission.

18.D.1. Relevant provisions of the ConventionThe  provisions  that  specifically  refer  to  national  communications  from  non-Annex I Parties are mostly related to providing financial and technical supportto them. Article 4.3 requires Annex II Parties to “provide new and additionalfinancial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing countryParties in complying with their obligations” under Article 12.1.,1
Article  4.7  states  that  “the  extent  to  which  developing  country  Parties  willeffectively implement their commitments under the Convention [which includessubmitting  national  communications]  will  depend  on the  effectiveimplementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under theConvention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and willtake  fully  into  account  that  economic  and  social  development  and  povertyeradication  are  the  first  and  overriding  priorities  of the  developing  countryParties”. This  Article  is  recalled  in  the  current  guidelines  for  nationalcommunications from non-Annex I Parties254.,1
"Furthermore, Article 12.7 states that, from its first session, “the Conference ofthe  Parties  shall  arrange  for  the  provision  to  developing  country  Parties  oftechnical and financial support, on request, in compiling and communicatinginformation … Such support may be provided by other Parties, by competentinternational organizations and by the secretariat, as appropriate”.",1
"As a specific element of non-Annex I Parties’ national communications, Article12.4  provides  that  developing  country  Parties  “may, on  a  voluntary  basis,propose  projects  for  financing,including  specific  technologies, materials,equipment, techniques or practices that would be needed to implement suchprojects, along  with, if possible, an  estimate  of all  incremental  costs, of thereductions of emissions and increments of removals of greenhouse gases, aswell as an estimate of the consequent benefits”.",1

The  preparation  of second  nationalcommunications will be based on these, as will the preparation of third, and,where  appropriate,initial  national  communications. The  secretariat  hasproduced a manual256 to facilitate the use of the new guidelines, available inthree United Nations languages (English, French and Spanish).

"National GHG inventory: according to the initial guidelines (decision 10/CP.2),Parties had to estimate GHG emissions and removals for the year 1994, oralternatively provide data for 1990. According to the new guidelines (decision17/CP.8), Parties are to estimate inventories for the year 2000. Least developedcountry Parties can estimate their inventories for years at their discretion. In preparingtheir national inventories, Parties should use the revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, whichare also used by Annex I Parties (see section 18.C). Parties are also encouraged toapply the IPCC good practice guidance (see section 18.C). They are alsoencouraged to describe procedures and arrangements used to collect and archivedata for national GHG inventories. They should also document efforts to make this acontinuous process, including information on the role of the institutions involved.Parties are further encouraged to provide information on methodologies used inestimating GHG emissions and removals.The inventories are to cover, as appropriate and to the extent possible, direct GHGsi.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Parties are alsoencouraged to provide information on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons(PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and on indirect GHGs (see Box 18.7) such ascarbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane volatile organiccompounds (NMVOCs). Other gases not controlled by the Montreal protocol, such assulphur oxides (SOx), may be included at the discretion of Parties.Parties should, to the extent possible, report emissions from international aviationand marine bunker fuels (see Box 18.6) separately in their inventories. Emissionestimates from these sources should not be included in the national totals.General description of steps taken or envisaged to implement theConvention: Parties are to detail programmes containing measures to facilitateadequate adaptation to climate change and measures to mitigate climate change.This refers to the implementation of Article 4.1(b) which requires all Parties toformulate, implement, publish and regularly update such programmes nationallyand, where appropriate, regionally.In reporting on their steps related to adaptation programmes, Parties shouldprovide information on their vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change, andon adaptation measures being taken to meet their specific needs and concernsarising from these adverse effects. The section on adaptation programmes mayinclude information on national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) for LDCs(see chapter 12).Parties may use appropriate methodologies and guidelines257 that they considerbetter able to reflect their national situation for assessing their vulnerability andadaptation to climate change, provided that these methodologies and guidelines areconsistent, transparent and well documented.
