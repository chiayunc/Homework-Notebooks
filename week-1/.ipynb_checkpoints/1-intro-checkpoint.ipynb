      "</p>, <p>Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_learning\" title=\"Machine learning\">Machine learning</a> classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Neuendorf2016_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Neuendorf2016-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Synonym\" title=\"Synonym\">synonyms</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Homonym\" title=\"Homonym\">homonyms</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and <a href=\"/wiki/Thematic_analysis\" title=\"Thematic analysis\">thematic analysis</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Quantitative content analysis highlights frequency counts and objective analysis of these coded frequencies.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Additionally, quantitative content analysis begins with a framed hypothesis with coding decided on before the analysis begins. These coding categories are strictly relevant to the researcher's hypothesis. Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p><a href=\"/wiki/Siegfried_Kracauer\" title=\"Siegfried Kracauer\">Siegfried Kracauer</a> provides a critique of quantitative analysis, asserting that it oversimplifies complex communications in order to be more reliable. On the other hand, qualitative analysis deals with the intricacies of latent interpretations, whereas quantitative has a focus on manifest meanings. He also acknowledges an \"overlap\" of qualitative and quantitative content analysis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed. It is inductive and begins with open research questions, as opposed to a hypothesis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>More generally, content analysis is research using the categorization and classification of speech, written text, interviews, images, or other forms of communication.  In its beginnings, using the first newspapers at the end of the 19th century, analysis was done manually by measuring the number of columns given a subject. The approach can also be traced back to a university student studying patterns in Shakespeare's literature in 1893.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> With the rise of common computing facilities like PCs, computer-based methods of analysis are growing in popularity.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> Answers to open ended questions, newspaper articles, political party manifestos, medical records or systematic observations in experiments can all be subject to systematic analysis of textual data.\n",
      "</p>, <p>By having contents of communication available in form of machine readable texts, the input is analyzed for frequencies and coded into categories for building up inferences.\n",
      "</p>, <p>Computer-assisted analysis can help with large, electronic data sets by cutting out time and eliminating the need for multiple human coders to establish inter-coder reliability. However, human coders can still be employed for content analysis, as they are often more able to pick out nuanced and latent meanings in text. A study  found that human coders were able to evaluate a broader range and make inferences based on latent meanings.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Robert Weber notes: \"To make valid inferences from the text, it is important that the classification procedure be reliable in the sense of being consistent: Different people should code the same text in the same way\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup> The validity, inter-coder reliability and intra-coder reliability are subject to intense methodological research efforts over long years.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "Neuendorf suggests that when human coders are used in content analysis at least two independent coders should be used.

The conference \\nincluded the three governing bodies of the UN Framework \\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, \\nand the Paris Agreement, and the three subsidiary bodies. The \\nKatowice Climate Change Conference brought together over \\n22,000 participants, including nearly 14,000 government officials, \\nover 7,000 representatives from UN bodies and agencies, \\nintergovernmental organizations, and civil society organizations, \\nand 1,500 members of the media.\\n\\nTasked with delivering a “rule book” for the Paris Agreement, \\nand amid calls for greater ambition to address the climate crisis, \\nthe Katowice Climate Change Conference largely delivered, by \\nproducing a package that facilitate countries’ efforts to implement \\nthe Paris Agreement.\\n\\nThis meeting focused on completing work on the Paris \\n\\nAgreement Work Programme (PAWP), a set of decisions meant to \\noperationalize the Paris Agreement. To this end, parties adopted \\nthe Katowice Climate Package, which includes decisions on \\nnearly all of the issues mandated as part of the PAWP, including:\\n•  on mitigation: further guidance in relation to nationally \\n\\ndetermined contributions (NDCs), common time frames, and \\nmodalities, work programme, and functions under the Paris \\nAgreement of the forum on the impact of the implementation \\nof response measures;\\n\\n•  on adaptation: further guidance on adaptation communication;\\n•  on finance: identification of the information to be provided \\n\\nby parties in accordance with Agreement Article 9.5 (ex ante \\nfinance transparency), matters relating to the Adaptation Fund, \\nand setting a new collective quantified goal on finance;\\n•  on technology: scope of and modalities for the periodic \\n\\nassessment of the Technology Mechanism, and the technology \\nframework\\n\\n•  the modalities, procedures, and guidelines for the transparency \\n\\nframework for action and support;\\n\\n•  the global stocktake; and\\n•  modalities and procedures for the effective operation of \\nthe committee to facilitate implementation and promote \\ncompliance.\\n\\nA Brief History of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, \\n\\nand the Paris Agreement\\n\\nThe international political response to climate change began \\n\\nwith the 1992 adoption of the UN Framework Convention \\non Climate Change (UNFCCC), which sets out the basic \\n\\nlegal framework and principles for international climate \\nchange cooperation with the aim of stabilizing atmospheric \\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid “dangerous \\nanthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The \\nConvention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, has 197 \\nparties.\\n\\nIn this Issue\\n\\nA Brief History of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, \\nand the Paris Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1\\n\\nReport of the Meetings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2\\n\\nParis Agreement Work Programme . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\\n  Conference of the Parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4\\n  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting \\n  of the Parties to the Paris Agreement   . . . . . . . . . . . . . .5\\n  Ad hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement  . . . . . .5\\n  Subsidiary Body for Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . .14\\n  Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological \\n  Advice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .17\\n\\nItems Other than the Paris Agreement Work \\nProgramme  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .19\\n  Conference of the Parties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .19\\n  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting \\n  of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol   . . . . . . . . . . . . . .23\\n  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting \\n  of the Parties to the Paris Agreement   . . . . . . . . . . . . .24\\n  Subsidiary Body for Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . .24\\n  Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological \\n  Advice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .28\\nJoint COP/CMP/CMA Closing Plenary . . . . . . . . . . . .30\\n \\n\\nA Brief Analysis of the Katowice Climate Change \\nConference  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .31\\n\\nUpcoming Meetings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .33\\n\\nGlossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .34\\n\\n  Earth Negotiations BulletinA Reporting Service for Environment and Development NegotiationsOnline at: http://enb.iisd.org/climate/cop24/enb/Tuesday, 18 December 2018Vol. 12 No. 747COP24 FINALThis issue of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin © <enb@iisd.org> is written and edited by Jennifer Allan, Ph.D., Beate Antonich, Ph.D., Jennifer Bansard, Katherine Browne, Natalie Jones, and Mari Luomi, Ph.D. The Digital Editor is Kiara Worth.

It commits \\nindustrialized countries, and countries in transition to a market \\neconomy, to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets for \\na basket of six GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force \\non 16 February 2005 and has 192 parties. Its first commitment \\nperiod took place from 2008 to 2012. The 2012 Doha Amendment \\nestablished the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020. \\nIt will enter into force after reaching 144 ratifications. As of \\nDecember 2018, 121 parties have ratified the Doha Amendment.  \\nIn December 2015, parties adopted the Paris Agreement. Under \\n\\nthe terms of the Agreement, all countries will submit NDCs, \\nand aggregate progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means \\nof implementation will be reviewed every five years through \\na global stocktake. The Paris Agreement entered into force on \\n4 November 2016 and, as of December 2018, 184 parties had \\nratified the Agreement.\\n\\nRecent Turning Points\\n\\nDurban Mandate: The negotiating mandate for the Paris \\n\\nAgreement was adopted at the UN Climate Change Conference \\nin Durban, South Africa, in 2011. Parties agreed to launch the \\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced \\nAction (ADP) with a mandate “to develop a protocol, another \\nlegal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the \\nConvention applicable to all Parties” no later than 2015, to enter \\ninto force in 2020. In addition, the ADP was mandated to explore \\nactions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap in relation to the 2°C \\ntarget.\\n\\nLima: The 2014 UN Climate Change Conference in Lima, \\n\\nPeru, adopted the “Lima Call for Climate Action,” which \\nfurthered progress on the negotiations towards the Paris \\nAgreement. It elaborated the elements of a draft negotiating \\ntext and the process for submitting and synthesizing intended \\nnationally determined contributions (INDCs), while also \\naddressing pre-2020 ambition.\\n\\nParis: The 2015 UN Climate Change Conference convened \\n\\nin Paris, France, and culminated in the adoption of the Paris \\nAgreement on 12 December. The Agreement includes the goal \\nof limiting global average temperature increase to well below \\n2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit \\nit to 1.5°C. It also aims to increase parties’ ability to adapt \\nto the adverse impacts of climate change and make financial \\nflows consistent with a pathway towards low-GHG emissions \\nand climate resilient development. The Agreement will be \\nimplemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light \\nof different national circumstances. \\n\\nUnder the Paris Agreement, each party shall communicate, \\nat five-year intervals, successively more ambitious NDCs. By \\n2020, parties whose NDCs contain a time frame up to 2025 are \\nrequested to communicate a new NDC and parties with an NDC \\ntime frame up to 2030 are requested to communicate or update \\nthese contributions.\\n\\nKey features of the Paris Agreement include a transparency \\n\\nframework and a process known as the global stocktake. \\nBeginning in 2023, parties will convene this process at five-year \\nintervals to review collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, \\nand means of implementation. The Agreement also includes \\nprovisions on adaptation, finance, technology, loss and damage, \\nand compliance.\\n\\nWhen adopting the Paris Agreement, parties launched the \\n\\nParis Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) to develop the \\nAgreement’s operational details, including through the Ad hoc \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 2\\n\\nWorking Group for the Paris Agreement (APA), Subsidiary Body \\nfor Implementation (SBI), and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific \\nand Technological Advice (SBSTA). They agreed to convene in \\n2018 a facilitative dialogue to take stock of collective progress \\ntowards the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals. This process is \\nnow known as the Talanoa Dialogue. \\n\\nIn Paris, parties also agreed on the need to mobilize stronger \\nand more ambitious climate action by all parties and non-party \\nstakeholders to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals. Building on \\nthe Lima-Paris Action Agenda, several non-party stakeholders \\nmade unilateral mitigation pledges in Paris, totaling more than \\n10,000 registered actions. Attention to actions by non-party \\nstakeholders continued through the Marrakech Partnership for \\nGlobal Climate Action, launched in 2016.\\n\\nMarrakech: The UN Climate Change Conference in \\n\\nMarrakech took place from 7-18 November 2016, and included \\nthe first Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the \\nParties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1). Parties adopted several \\ndecisions related to the PAWP, including: that the work should \\nconclude by 2018; the terms of reference for the Paris Committee \\non Capacity-building; and initiating a process to identify the \\ninformation to be provided in accordance with Agreement Article \\n9.5 (ex ante biennial finance communications by developed \\ncountries). Other decisions adopted included approving the five-\\nyear workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss \\nand Damage (WIM), enhancing the Technology Mechanism, and \\ncontinuing and enhancing the Lima work programme on gender.\\n\\nFiji/Bonn: The Fiji/Bonn Climate Change Conference \\nconvened from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany, \\nunder the Presidency of Fiji. The Conference of the Parties \\n(COP) launched the Talanoa Dialogue and established the \\n“Fiji Momentum for Implementation,” a decision that gives \\nprominence to pre-2020 implementation and ambition. The COP \\nalso provided guidance on the completion of the PAWP and \\ndecided that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the Paris Agreement, \\nsubject to decisions to be taken by the next meeting of the CMA. \\nParties also further developed, or gave guidance to, the Local \\nCommunities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, the Executive \\nCommittee of the WIM, the Standing Committee on Finance, and \\nthe Adaptation Fund.\\n\\nIntersessional work in 2018: The subsidiary bodies met in \\n\\nJune and September 2018. At the close of the second meeting in \\nBangkok, progress was captured in a 307-page compilation and \\nmany characterized this progress as “uneven and insufficient.” \\nA unique feature of the intersessional meetings was the Talanoa \\nDialogue. In a process designed around the questions “Where are \\nwe?” “Where do we want to go?” and “How do we get there?” \\nparties and stakeholders shared stories that informed a synthesis \\nreport presented at the Katowice Climate Change Conference.\\n\\nReport of the Meetings\\n\\nDuring the formal opening of the Katowice Climate Change \\nConference on Monday, 3 December 2018, COP 23 President \\nFrank Bainimarama (Fiji) underscored that when it comes to \\nclimate change “we are all in the same canoe.” He presented COP \\n24 President Michał Kurtyka (Poland), with the gavel, remarking \\nthat it “represents all parties’ efforts over the years to bring us to \\nthis point.”\\n\\nSaying the world faces “yet another historic test” at COP 24, \\nPolish President Andrzej Duda highlighted that Poland’s GHG \\nemissions have declined by 30% below 1988 levels while its \\neconomy has grown, stressing the contribution of efficient coal \\ntechnologies.\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 3\\n\\nStating that “we are in deep trouble with climate change,” UN \\n\\nSecretary-General António Guterres shared four messages:\\n•  science demands a significantly more ambitious response to \\n\\nthe challenge of climate change;\\n\\n•  the Paris Agreement provides the framework for the needed \\n\\ntransformative action and must be operationalized in Katowice;\\n•  there is a collective responsibility to invest in averting “global \\n\\nclimate chaos”; and\\n\\n•  climate action offers a compelling path to transformation, but \\n\\npolitical will and more far-sighted leadership are required.\\nReminding delegates that the world is watching, María \\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the UN General \\nAssembly, acknowledged that negotiations would be difficult, but \\nurged parties to see COP 24 as an opportunity to demonstrate the \\neffectiveness of multilateralism at a time when its legitimacy is \\nchallenged.\\n\\nHenryk Kowalczyk, Minister of Environment, Poland, \\n\\nhighlighted the expectation for COP 24 to deliver the package \\nneeded to bring the Paris Agreement to life.\\n\\nExplaining that the story of the region surrounding Katowice is \\n“a story of transition,” COP 24 President Kurtyka said the path to \\na “deep but just transition” requires: vision, hope, and confidence \\nthat “we will get there”; reassurance to people that they will not \\nbe left behind; and transparent, implementable rules and a system \\nof support.\\n\\nKristalina Georgieva, Chief Executive Officer, World Bank, \\nannounced the Bank’s intent to double its support for climate \\nfinance, pledging USD 200 billion for climate action, including \\nUSD 50 billion for adaptation and resilience. She said the World \\nBank will use a “climate lens” in all its work, apply a shadow \\ncarbon price in its economic valuations, and work to integrate \\nlow-carbon growth into policy planning.\\n\\nMarcin Krupa, Mayor of Katowice, highlighted the city’s \\n\\nmotto of “black to green,” underscoring that COP 24 is an \\nopportunity for Katowice to share its experiences of transitioning \\nfrom a coal-mining town to a modern metropolis.\\n\\nPresenting the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia \\n\\nDeclaration, President Duda stressed the importance of bringing \\ntogether the broadest possible coalition of stakeholders and \\ndelivering win-win solutions and gradual change acceptable to \\nall. He said the declaration complements the Paris Agreement by \\nadding an important social aspect.\\n\\nSir David Attenborough, BBC, delivered the “People’s Seat” \\naddress, noting that he represented the voice of the people and \\nsought to deliver their collective thoughts, concerns, ideas, and \\nsuggestions directly to decision makers. Underscoring that “the \\nmessage is clear,” he called on leaders to act now to ensure the \\ncontinuation of human civilization and the preservation of the \\nnatural world.\\n\\nOn Sunday, 2 December, parties’ opening statements were \\n\\nheard in a joint plenary of the Conference of the Parties (COP), \\nConference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to \\nthe Kyoto Protocol (CMP), and Conference of the Parties serving \\nas the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA), \\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group for the Paris Agreement (APA), \\nSubsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and the Subsidiary \\nBody for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).\\n\\nEgypt, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), stressed \\n\\nthe need for balance between action and support, and urged \\nreasonable comparability across issues, “leaving no issue behind.” \\nHe noted that finance could “unlock” other issues, and called \\nfor upholding common but differentiated responsibilities and \\nrespective capabilities (CBDR-RC) in the outcome.\\n\\nThe European Union (EU) underscored that the outcome \\n\\nfrom Katowice must be in line with the spirit and letter of the \\nParis Agreement, taking into account national capacities and \\ncircumstances and ensuring the highest possible ambition over \\ntime. On the Talanoa Dialogue, he urged parties to reflect on \\nlevels of ambition in the light of the latest climate science.\\n\\nRepublic of Korea, for the Environmental Integrity Group \\n(EIG), called for living up to the promises made in Paris and \\nstressed that delaying work beyond COP 24 is not an option. He \\nalso drew attention to the Talanoa Dialogue, urging parties to look \\nfor opportunities to close the ambition gap.\\n\\nAustralia, for the Umbrella Group, said the group would work \\nas hard and constructively as possible to conclude comprehensive \\nand robust guidance for the Paris Agreement.\\n\\nDescribing the Paris Agreement as an enhanced regime guided \\nby equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), \\nGabon, for the African Group, outlined as core elements of the \\noutcome, inter alia, finance, including the full operationalization \\nof Paris Agreement Article 9.5 (ex ante finance transparency). He \\nwelcomed the presiding officers’ addenda, which were published \\nintersessionally and provided textual proposals, but said the group \\nwould be making submissions on elements that were left out.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, emphasized the need \\nto: preserve the balance between issues laid out in the Paris \\nAgreement; achieve a consistent package reflecting parties’ \\ntextual submissions; and bear in mind national circumstances.\\nMaldives, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), \\n\\npointed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\n(IPCC) Special Report on the impacts of global warming \\nof 1.5°C, underscoring the urgency of restoring a spirit of \\nmultilateral cooperation that is not impeded by narrow national \\ninterests. He called for, inter alia, a COP decision on the Talanoa \\nDialogue outcome.\\n\\nEthiopia, for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), \\n\\nemphasized the need for improved predictability of financial \\nflows through addressing ex ante information, and highlighted \\nloss and damage as a critical component of the global response to \\nclimate change.\\n\\nUnderscoring equity as a core principle, Iran, for the Like-\\n\\nMinded Developing Countries (LMDCs), called for: a balanced \\ntreatment of all items leading to a singular omnibus decision and \\nconstructive engagement by developed countries on matters of \\nfinance and technology transfer.\\n\\nHighlighting the vulnerability of her region, Colombia, for \\nthe Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean \\n(AILAC), stressed that effective implementation of the \\nParis Agreement requires consideration of countries’ special \\ncircumstances. She urged achievement of tangible results from \\nmandated events, especially the Talanoa Dialogue.\\n\\nIndia, for Brazil, South Africa, India, and China, underscored \\nthat the PAWP should support enhanced ambition without “back-\\nsliding” on rules.

The agenda items related to \\nthe PAWP are summarized below, culminating with the Katowice \\nClimate Package, organized by the agendas of the APA, SBI, \\nSBSTA, COP, CMP, and CMA. For non-PAWP items, the \\ndiscussions by the six bodies are summarized according to their \\nagendas.\\n\\nParis Agreement Work Programme\\n\\nThe Paris outcome (decision 1/CP.21) mandates the APA, SBI, \\nand SBSTA to consider several issues necessary to operationalize \\nthe Paris Agreement. The APA, SBI, and SBSTA met during the \\nfirst week and submitted their draft texts to the COP for further \\ndiscussion in the second week. On 15 December, the COP \\nadopted the decisions, and forwarded them to the CMP and CMA, \\nas appropriate. Decisions were taken by the COP, CMP, and \\nCMA. \\n\\nConference of the Parties\\n\\nThe COP began work on preparations for the Implementation \\n\\nof the Paris Agreement and CMA 1 on Saturday, 8 December, \\nwhen it received the latest iterations of the various texts from the \\nthree subsidiary bodies, as described above. Discussions took \\nplace in presidency consultations for issues related to the work \\nof the PAWP and for the decision adopting the Katowice Climate \\nPackage.\\n\\nOn the Talanoa Dialogue and the IPCC Special Report on \\n\\n1.5°C, co-facilitated by Isabella Lövin, Deputy Prime Minister \\nand Minister for International Development Cooperation and \\nClimate, Sweden, and Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Minister of \\nEnvironment and Energy, Costa Rica, the consultations focused \\non: how the outcome of the Talanoa Dialogue should be captured; \\nwhat type of indications should be given to parties for preparing \\ntheir NDCs; and how the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C should \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 4\\n\\nbe recognized. In consultations, many parties emphasized the \\nneed to state the importance of science and the work of the IPCC \\nauthors, and to raise ambition.\\n\\nOther consultations are summarized under their respective \\n\\nagenda items.\\n\\nAfter the co-facilitating ministers reported on their progress on \\nThursday, 13 December, COP 24 Presidency Kurtyka announced \\nthat negotiations would take place in a “Sejmik,” a meeting of \\nministers with a few delegates for support, similar to a Vienna \\nsetting. Negotiations continued in bilateral and informal informal \\nnegotiations. On Saturday, 15 December, the COP adopted the \\nKatowice Climate Package, and forwarded the decisions to the \\nCMA for adoption.\\n\\nFinal Decision: In its final decision on the Katowice Climate \\n\\nPackage (FCCC/CP/2018/L.27), the COP, inter alia, reaffirms \\nthat, in the context of NDCs to the global response to climate \\nchange, all parties are to undertake and communicate ambitious \\nefforts; and decides to forward 19 decisions for consideration and \\nadoption by CMA 1-3.\\n\\nOn the Third High-level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate \\n\\nFinance, the COP:\\n•  notes that it highlighted progress in and remaining barriers to \\n\\ntranslating climate finance needs into action and enhancing \\ndeveloping countries’ access to climate finance;\\n\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the pledges and announcements \\n\\nto the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Least Developed Countries \\nFund (LDCF), and Adaptation Fund, which provide further \\nclarity to and predictability on climate finance flows to 2020.\\nOn implementation and ambition, pre- and post-2020, the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia:\\n•  underscores the urgent need for the entry into force of the \\n\\nDoha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol;\\n\\n•  reiterates its resolve to enhance the provision of urgent and \\nadequate finance, technology, and capacity-building support \\nby developed country parties to enhance the level of ambition \\nof pre-2020 action, and in this regard strongly urges developed \\ncountry parties to scale up their level of financial support, \\nwith a concrete road map to achieve the goal of jointly \\nmobilizing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation \\nand adaptation, while significantly increasing adaptation \\nfinance from current levels and to further provide appropriate \\ntechnology and capacity-building support;\\n\\n•  further reiterates its request to those parties whose intended \\nNDC contains a time frame up to 2025 to communicate by \\n2020 a new NDC and to do so every five years thereafter; and\\n\\n•  reiterates its request to those parties whose intended NDC \\n\\ncontains a time frame up to 2030 to communicate or update by \\n2020 the contribution and to do so every five years thereafter.\\n\\nOn the Special Report of the IPCC, the COP:\\n•  recognizes the role of the IPCC in providing scientific input to \\ninform parties in strengthening the global response to the threat \\nof climate change in the context of sustainable development \\nand efforts to eradicate poverty; \\n\\n•  expresses its appreciation and gratitude to the IPCC and the \\n\\nscientific community for responding to the request of the COP \\nand providing the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, \\nreflecting the best available science;\\n\\n•  welcomes the timely completion of the IPCC Special Report \\n\\non Global Warming of 1.5°C in response to the invitation from \\nparties in decision 1/CP.21 (the Paris outcome);\\n\\n•  invites parties to make use of the information contained in the \\n\\nreport in their discussions under all relevant agenda items of \\nthe subsidiary and governing bodies; \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 5\\n\\n•  requests SBSTA 50 to consider the report with a view to \\nstrengthening the scientific knowledge on the 1.5°C goal, \\nincluding in the context of the preparation of the Sixth \\nAssessment Report of the IPCC and the implementation of the \\nConvention and the Paris Agreement; and \\n\\n•  encourages parties to continue to support the work of the \\n\\nIPCC.\\n\\nOn the Talanoa Dialogue, the COP, inter alia:\\n•  takes note of the outcome, inputs, and outputs of the Talanoa \\nDialogue and their potential to generate greater confidence, \\ncourage, and enhanced ambition; \\n\\n•  invites parties to consider the outcome, inputs and outputs of \\n\\nthe Talanoa Dialogue in preparing their NDCs and in their \\nefforts to enhance pre-2020 implementation and ambition.\\nOn the modalities, procedures, and guidelines (MPGs) for \\nthe transparency framework (Agreement Article 13), the COP, \\ninter alia:\\n•  decides that for parties to the Convention that are also parties \\nto the Paris Agreement, the final biennial reports shall be those \\nthat are submitted to the Secretariat no later than 31 December \\n2022, and the final biennial update reports shall be those that \\nare submitted to the Secretariat no later than 31 December \\n2024; \\n\\n•  reaffirms that for parties to the Paris Agreement, following the \\n\\nsubmission of the final biennial reports and biennial update \\nreports, the Paris Agreement transparency framework MPGs \\nwill supersede the measurement, reporting, and verification \\nsystem established by decision 1/CP.16 (Cancun Agreements);\\n•  also reaffirms the reporting obligations under Articles 4 and 12 \\n\\nof the Convention;\\n\\n•  decides in this context that, for parties to the Paris Agreement, \\nthe biennial transparency reports, technical expert review, and \\nfacilitative, multilateral consideration of progress prepared \\nand conducted in accordance with the Paris Agreement \\ntransparency framework MPGs shall replace the biennial \\nreports, biennial update reports, international assessment and \\nreview, and international consultation and analysis; and \\n\\n•  decides that, to fulfil national inventory reporting obligations \\n\\nunder the Convention, parties to the Paris Agreement \\nsubmitting annual national inventory reports under the \\nConvention shall use the MPGs for national inventory reports \\nfor the Paris Agreement transparency framework; by the date \\nthat reports are first due under the Paris Agreement with the \\ntechnical expert review to be conducted in accordance with the \\ncorresponding modalities, procedures, and guidelines for the \\nParis Agreement transparency, in place of the GHG inventory \\nreporting guidelines and the review guidelines, respectively, \\nincluding in years in which a biennial transparency report is \\nnot due under the Paris Agreement.\\nThe COP further decides that, with respect to the reporting and \\n\\nreview of national communications under the Convention every \\nfour years, starting from the date that reports are first due under \\nthe Paris Agreement: \\n•  parties may submit their national communication and biennial \\n\\ntransparency report as a single report in accordance with \\nthe Paris Agreement transparency framework MPGs for \\ninformation also covered by the national communication \\nreporting guidelines under the Convention; \\n\\n•  parties shall include in the report supplemental chapters on \\n\\nresearch and systematic observation and on education, training, \\nand public awareness; \\n\\n•  for those parties that have not reported under Chapter IV of \\n\\nthe annex to transparency framework MPGs (information \\nrelated to adaptation), an additional chapter on adaptation, \\n\\nin accordance with the relevant guidelines contained in, as \\napplicable, Decisions 4/CP.5 (Buenos Aires Plan of Action) and \\n17/CP.8 (guidelines for national communications; and\\n\\n•  for those parties whose national communications are subject \\nto review, the review shall be conducted in accordance with \\nthe relevant guidelines contained in Chapter VII of the Paris \\nAgreement transparency framework MPGs. \\n\\nThe COP also:\\n•  decides that the technical annex containing modalities for \\nmeasuring, reporting, and verifying the activities referred \\nto in Decision 1/CP.16 (Cancun Agreements), paragraph \\n70 (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest \\nDegradation (REDD+)), shall be submitted as an annex to the \\nbiennial transparency report; and\\n\\n•  decides that the technical analysis related to modalities for \\nmeasuring, reporting, and verifying the activities related to \\nREDD+ shall be carried out concurrently with the technical \\nexpert review under transparency framework of the Paris \\nAgreement.\\nOn the Leaders’ Summit, the COP welcomes leaders’ \\n\\nparticipation and notes the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia \\nDeclaration.\\n\\nOn the UN Climate Summit in 2019, the COP welcomes the \\ninitiative and calls on parties to participate and to demonstrate \\nenhanced ambition in addressing climate change.\\n\\nConference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the \\nParties to the Paris Agreement \\n\\nOn 15 December, the CMA adopted the Katowice Climate \\n\\nPackage, a series of decisions under the Paris Agreement Work \\nProgramme meant to operationalize the Paris Agreement. There \\nis an overarching decision, and several other decisions clustered \\nalong relevant themes.\\n\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/PA/CMA/2018/L.4), the \\n\\nCMA: \\n•  adopts the draft decisions on matters relating to the PAWP \\n\\nforwarded by COP 24 and the SBI;\\n\\n•  confirms that the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), the \\n\\nLDCF, and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) shall \\nserve the Paris Agreement;\\n\\n•  requests the SCF to prepare draft guidance for the entities \\n\\nentrusted with the operation of the Financial Mechanism, and \\nthe LDCF and the SCCF, for consideration and adoption by \\nCMA 2;\\n\\n•  confirms that it shall provide guidance to the entities \\n\\nentrusted with the operation of the Financial Mechanism \\nof the Convention on the policies, programme priorities, \\nand eligibility criteria related to the Paris Agreement for \\ntransmission by the COP;\\n\\n•  recognizes the importance of capacity building under the \\n\\nAgreement in enhancing the capacity and ability of developing \\ncountries, in particular countries with the least capacity and \\nthose that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of \\nclimate change, to take effective climate change action; and\\n•  decides to consider and adopt at CMA 2 a decision on the \\n\\ninitial institutional arrangements for capacity building.\\n\\nAd-hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement\\n\\nThe APA convened from Sunday, 2 December, through \\n\\nSaturday, 8 December, when it adopted the APA conclusions. \\nOn 8 December, the APA Co-Chairs, Jo Tyndall (New Zealand) \\nand Sarah Baashan (Saudi Arabia), forwarded their proposed text \\nto the COP, where it was taken up in presidency consultations \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cand at the ministerial level. Unless otherwise mentioned, on 15 \\nDecember, the COP adopted decisions to be forwarded to the \\nCMA as part of the Katowice Climate Package. \\n\\nFurther Guidance on the Mitigation Section of decision 1/\\nCP.21 (Paris Outcome): Discussions under this item focused on:\\n•  developing further guidance on features of the NDCs, which \\neach party is required to prepare, communicate, and maintain \\nunder Agreement Article 4.2;\\n\\n•  developing further guidance for the information to be provided \\n\\nby parties in order to facilitate clarity, transparency, and \\nunderstanding (ICTU) of NDCs; and\\n\\n•  elaborating guidance for accounting for NDCs.\\n\\nThis item was discussed in informal consultations, \\n\\nco-facilitated by Federica Fricano (Italy) and Sin Liang Cheah \\n(Singapore), which met in six sessions. In addition, parties met \\nin “informal informal” settings throughout the first week. In the \\ninformal consultations, parties focused on, first, the presiding \\nofficers’ addendum and, later, iterations of the text prepared by \\nthe Co-Facilitators, containing preambular text and operational \\ntext on features of NDCs, ICTU, and accounting.\\n\\nIn general, views strongly diverged on reflecting differentiation \\n\\nand the need to reflect mitigation as a mandatory requirement in \\nNDCs. Parties generally expressed agreement on text on capacity-\\nbuilding support to developing countries for NDCs.\\n\\nIn the preambular section, many welcomed reference to \\n\\ndeveloping countries’ different starting points, capacities, and \\nnational circumstances, and highlighted the importance of \\ncapacity-building support. Parties diverged on whether to refer to \\nAgreement Article 3 (NDCs), with some stressing that the scope \\nof guidance under this agenda item is mitigation only and others \\nsaying it applies to the “full scope” of NDCs.\\n\\nOn features of NDCs, parties diverged on whether, and when, \\n\\nto continue consideration of further guidance. A number of groups \\nand countries supported a limited text, with many stating that \\nfeatures are already defined in relevant provisions of the Paris \\nAgreement. Some suggested agreeing on a few specific features \\nat COP 24 and mandating future sessions to develop guidance \\nfor the second round of NDCs. Countries diverged on whether to \\ncontinue consideration of further guidance on features of NDCs \\nat CMA 7 (2024), and on a possible future year for a revision of \\nguidance.\\n\\nOn ICTU, parties diverged on the legally binding nature \\n\\nof the Paris outcome (decision 1/CP.21) paragraph 27 (ICTU) \\nand operationalizing differentiation, and on the scope and \\nlevel of detail needed for guidance for ICTU. On bindingness \\nand differentiation, parties diverged on whether and how to \\nreference Agreement Article 4.4 (developed countries taking \\nthe lead and developing countries continuing to enhance \\nefforts). One developing country called for either differentiating \\nbetween developed and developing countries or inserting “if/\\nas applicable/appropriate” in various parts of the text. Many \\ndeveloped and developing countries suggested including “as \\napplicable/appropriate” in some elements as a way to allow \\nfor differentiation or flexibility for developing countries. One \\ndeveloping country group and two developed countries said all \\ncountries “shall” provide ICTU “as applicable.” \\n\\nOn ICTU elements, parties exchanged views on, inter alia: \\n\\n•  quantifiable information; \\n•  time frames; \\n•  scope and coverage; \\n•  methodological approaches; \\n•  fairness and ambition of an NDC; \\n•  NDCs’ contribution to the Agreement’s objectives; and \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 6\\n\\n•  information on adaptation, support, and means of \\n\\nimplementation. \\nOne developing country further suggested adding how parties’ \\nNDCs demonstrate leadership, noting that Agreement Article 4.4 \\nalso specifies that developed countries should continue to take the \\nlead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction \\ntargets.  \\n\\n On the scope of ICTU guidance, one developing country \\n\\ngroup called for reintroducing language reflecting the full scope \\nof NDCs into the section on ICTU. The group also opposed \\nfurther consideration, or revision, of guidance on features and \\nICTU.\\n\\nOn accounting, many parties agreed on the importance of \\n\\nproviding guidance in this area. They shared views on, inter alia, \\nflexibility for developing countries, methodological consistency, \\nenvironmental integrity, and avoidance of double counting. \\nMany called for clarifying text relating to avoidance of double \\ncounting, with most suggesting references to corresponding \\nadjustments. One developed country group emphasized focusing \\non tracking progress of NDCs, accounting for quantified elements \\nof NDCs, and adjusting for internationally transferred mitigation \\noutcomes (ITMOs). Many noted the need for careful definition of \\nmitigation outcomes, with some stressing that these are nationally \\ndetermined, and others calling for a clear matrix. \\n\\nSeveral supported providing guidance that would prohibit \\ndouble counting, including by not allowing a country to use \\nmitigation outcomes from mechanisms outside of the Paris \\nAgreement context, including the International Civil Aviation \\nOrganization (ICAO), also in the Paris Agreement. One \\ndeveloping country called for brackets around text on avoidance \\nof double counting.\\n\\nOn interlinkages with other APA items, some warned that \\ndiscussing mitigation outcomes in the guidance on NDCs in \\naddition to the modalities of Agreement Article 6.2 (on ITMOs \\nused for NDCs) could open the door for trading mitigation \\noutcomes of any form, which would be inconsistent with \\nenvironmental integrity.\\n\\nThe text was forwarded to the APA and later to the COP for \\n\\nfurther consideration.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations on this issue, in \\nconjunction with other issues related to mitigation, co-facilitated \\nby Ola Elvestuen, Minister of Climate and Environment, Norway, \\nand Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water \\nResources, Singapore. Groups and countries shared their views \\non the third iteration of text, forwarded from the APA, identifying \\nareas for further technical work, with one group suggesting to \\nfirst discuss issues related to bindingness, timing of applicability, \\nand differentiation, and others suggesting that these should be \\nleft to ministers. Parties reiterated positions, requesting further \\nbrackets or deletion of paragraphs, and suggested areas for \\nstreamlining. Parties found some common ground in paragraphs \\nrelated to capacity-building support related to NDCs and \\navoidance of double counting.\\n\\nOn guidance on ICTU, parties continued to diverge on the: \\n\\n•  level of detail; \\n•  scope, namely whether to include elements other than \\n\\nmitigation; \\n\\n•  timing of applicability, namely “by 2020” or with the second \\n\\nand subsequent NDCs; and \\n\\n•  legal bindingness, namely whether all parties “shall provide” \\nICTU, with details determined by the NDC type, or developed \\ncountries “shall provide” and developing countries “may \\ninclude” ICTU.\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 7\\n\\nParties reflected on, inter alia: the level of detail in guidance \\n\\non fairness and ambition of NDCs; and public participation \\nand engagement and “contextual issues,” such as sustainable \\ndevelopment in NDC planning processes.\\n\\nOn accounting, parties made proposals related to: \\n\\n•  common metrics, including in relation to countries’ accounting \\n\\nusing methodologies not covered by the IPCC guidelines; \\n\\n•  timing of a possible review of the guidance; \\n•  capturing NDCs that contain targets expressed with policies \\n\\nand measures or strategies; and \\n\\n•  emissions and removals related to sources, sinks, or activities, \\n\\nwith one group suggesting referring to “all land area” and \\nsome others proposing adding “pools.”\\nMany called for further attention to how the substantive \\n\\nlinkages with the transparency framework and Agreement Article \\n6 (cooperative approaches) could be addressed in a way that \\nwould reduce redundancies in the different texts.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and the CMA adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.22), the \\n\\nCMA:\\n•  reaffirms and underscores that support shall be provided to \\ndeveloping countries for the implementation of Agreement \\nArticle 4 (mitigation), including to continue to enhance the \\ncapacity of developing countries in preparing, communicating \\nand accounting for their NDCs, and encourages the relevant \\noperating entities of the Financial Mechanism and constituted \\nbodies under the Convention serving the Agreement to \\ncontinue to provide, within their mandates, support for such \\ncapacity building;\\n\\n•  recalls that LDCs and SIDS may prepare and communicate \\n\\nstrategies, plans, and actions for low-GHG emission \\ndevelopment reflecting their special circumstances; and\\n•  also recalls Agreement Article 4.4, which provides that \\ndeveloped countries should continue taking the lead by \\nundertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets, \\nand that developing countries should continue enhancing \\ntheir mitigation efforts and are encouraged to move over time \\ntowards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets \\nin the light of different national circumstances.\\n\\nOn features of NDCs, the CMA:\\n•  decides that in communicating their second and subsequent \\nNDCs, parties shall provide the ICTU contained an annex \\nto the decision as applicable to their NDCs, and strongly \\nencourages parties to provide this information in relation to \\ntheir first NDC, including when communicating or updating it \\nby 2020;\\n\\n•  emphasizes that the guidance on ICTU is without prejudice to \\nthe inclusion of components other than mitigation in an NDC; \\nand\\n\\n•  recognizes that each party with an NDC that consists of \\n\\nmitigation co-benefits resulting from its adaptation action and/\\nor economic diversification plans shall provide the information \\nreferred to in the ICTU guidance annex as applicable to its \\nNDC and as it relates to such mitigation co-benefits.\\n\\nOn accounting, the CMA:\\n•  decides that, in accounting for anthropogenic emissions and \\nremovals corresponding to their NDCs, parties shall account \\nfor their NDCs in accordance with the guidance contained an \\nannex to the decision;\\n\\n•  recalls decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 32, which provides that \\nparties shall apply the guidance for accounting for NDCs to \\ntheir second and subsequent NDCs, and that parties may elect \\nto apply such guidance to their first NDC;\\n\\n•  decides that, in accounting for anthropogenic emissions and \\n\\nremovals corresponding to their NDCs, parties shall ensure the \\navoidance of double counting;\\n\\n•  recognizes that each party with an NDC that consists of \\n\\nmitigation co-benefits resulting from its adaptation action and/\\nor economic diversification plans shall follow the guidance \\ncontained in the accounting annex as it relates to such \\nmitigation co-benefits;\\n\\n•  decides that parties shall account for their NDCs in their \\n\\nbiennial transparency reports, including through a structured \\nsummary; and\\n\\n•  also decides to initiate the review of and, if necessary, update \\n\\nthe ICTU of NDCs and the guidance for accounting for parties’ \\nNDCs at CMA 10 (2027) with a view to considering and \\nadopting a decision on the matter at CMA 11 (2028).\\n\\nOn features, the CMA:\\n•  notes that features of NDCs are outlined in the relevant \\n\\nprovisions of the Agreement; and\\n\\n•  decides to continue consideration of further guidance on \\n\\nfeatures of NDCs at CMA 7 (2024).\\nThe decision contains an annex that outlines the guidance.\\nFurther Guidance in relation to the Adaptation \\n\\nCommunication: Agreement Article 7.10 states that each \\nparty should, as appropriate, submit and update periodically an \\nadaptation communication, which may include its priorities, \\nimplementation and support needs, plans, and actions. \\nDiscussions under this item focused on developing guidelines \\nfor this adaptation communication. This item was discussed in \\ninformal consultations that met six times and were co-facilitated \\nby Beth Lavender (Canada) and Julio Cordano (Chile). Parties \\nalso discussed this issue extensively in “informal informal” \\nsettings. \\n\\nParties discussed a developing country group’s proposal \\nto “take stock of, and if necessary, revise” the guidance on \\nadaptation communication at CMA 8 (2024), taking into account \\nparties’ submissions on their experience with using the guidance. \\nParties’ discussions centered on whether or how to identify a \\npurpose and principles for the guidance. \\n\\nOn purpose and principles, views differed on mentioning the \\n\\nprinciple of CBDR-RC, with several developing countries in \\nfavor of including the principle in the guidance, while developed \\ncountries opposed. Several developed countries opposed a section \\ndevoted to principles, instead suggesting that some principles \\ncould be mentioned in the preamble of the guidance. As an \\nalternative to defining a purpose for adaptation communication, a \\ndeveloped country proposed “underscoring the importance of an \\nadaptation communication as a vehicle for, inter alia,” the various \\nelements outlined in the addendum to the presiding officers’ \\njoint reflections note that was issued after the Bangkok meeting. \\nSome developed countries welcomed the flexibility this proposal \\nprovided, while some developing countries highlighted the need \\nto define a common understanding on the purpose of adaptation \\ncommunication.\\n\\nIn the second iteration of text, several parties lamented that the \\n\\nsection on principles had been removed.\\n\\nOn linkages with other APA items, several noted linkages with \\n\\nthe Global Stocktake (GST), the transparency framework, and \\nAPA agenda item 3 (further guidance on the mitigation section \\nof the Paris outcome). One developing country group supported \\nkeeping a reference to the NDC-specific guidance contained in \\nthe annex of the guidance, noting that there is no guidance for \\nadaptation communications that use NDCs as the vehicle, while \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cother vehicles, such as National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), have \\nguidance. Some developed countries calling for not prejudging \\ndiscussions held under APA agenda item 3. \\n\\nMany parties cautioned that references to the linkages between \\nthe adaptation communication and the GST should be viewed as a \\nplaceholder, in order not to prejudge the parallel GST discussions. \\n\\nOn the transparency framework, some countries expressed \\nconcern about the second iteration of the text, noting that the \\ntransparency framework text removed much of the detail in its \\nsection on climate change impacts and adaptation. They called for \\nimporting some of those elements into the guidance on adaptation \\ncommunication.\\n\\nOn support, there was a general sense that parties agreed on the \\nneed for support for the preparation of adaptation communication \\nbut needed more time to discuss support for implementation. \\nParties also discussed which parties and entities would provide \\nsuch support, with one developed country favoring a broad range \\nof actors, including parties and UN organizations, to continue to \\nmobilize funds. The text was forwarded to the APA, and later to \\nthe COP for further consideration.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations on this issue, in \\nconjunction with other issues related to adaptation, co-facilitated \\nby Kimmo Tiilikainen, Minister of the Environment, Energy and \\nHousing, Finland, and Lamin Dibba, Minister of Environment, \\nClimate Change and Natural Resources, The Gambia. On the \\nguidance for adaptation communication, views diverged on, inter \\nalia: \\n•  language introducing a degree of hierarchy between ex post \\nand forward-looking elements of adaptation communication; \\n\\n•  whether or not to consider existing guidance for \\n\\ncommunicating adaptation-related information; and\\n\\n•  whether and how information communicated as a component \\n\\nof, or in conjunction with, an NDC on adaptation actions \\nand/or economic diversification plans leading to mitigation \\nco-benefits would be subject to review.\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.21), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  notes that the purpose of the adaptation communication is to: \\nincrease the visibility and profile of adaptation and its balance \\nwith mitigation; strengthen adaptation action and support for \\ndeveloping countries; provide input to the GST; and enhance \\nlearning and understanding of adaptation needs and actions;\\n\\n•  decides that the adaptation communication: is country-driven \\n\\nand flexible, including in the choice of communication or \\ndocument; shall not pose any additional burden on developing \\ncountry parties; is not a basis for comparisons between parties; \\nand is not subject to a review;\\n\\n•  decides that parties may, as appropriate, also submit and \\n\\nupdate their adaptation communication as a component of \\nor in conjunction with the reports on impacts and adaptation \\nas stipulated in Agreement Article 13, paragraph 8 (provide \\ninformation related to impacts and adaptation); and\\n•  invites parties that choose to submit an adaptation \\n\\ncommunication to do so in time to inform each GST.\\n\\n•  invites parties, according to their national circumstances and \\n\\ncapacities, to provide in their adaptation communication \\ninformation on the elements referred to in subparagraphs \\n(a) to (d) of the annex (national circumstances, institutional \\narrangements and legal frameworks; impacts, risks and \\nvulnerabilities, as appropriate; national adaptation priorities, \\nstrategies, policies, plans, goals and actions; implementation \\nand support needs of, and provision of support to, developing \\ncountries); and to provide, as appropriate, additional \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 8\\n\\ninformation on the elements referred to in subparagraphs (e) \\nto (i) of the annex (implementation of adaptation actions and \\nplans; monitoring and evaluation; adaptation actions and/or \\neconomic diversification plans; information on how adaptation \\nactions contribute to other international frameworks and/or \\nConventions; information on gender-responsive adaptation \\naction and information on traditional knowledge, knowledge \\nof indigenous peoples and local knowledge systems related to \\nadaptation, where appropriate; any other information related to \\nadaptation);\\n\\n•  also invites parties to include, as appropriate, ex ante \\n\\ninformation in their adaptation communications, based on the \\nelements identified in the annex;\\n\\n•  requests the Adaptation Committee to develop, with the \\n\\nengagement of IPCC Working Group II, by June 2022, a draft \\nsupplementary guidance for voluntary use by parties, for \\nconsideration by SB 57 (November 2022);\\n\\n•  decides to take stock of, and if necessary, revise, the guidance \\ncontained in this decision, taking into account the submissions \\nby parties on their experiences with the application of the \\nguidance and a synthesis report of the submissions prepared by \\nthe Secretariat, at CMA 8 (2025);\\n\\n•  invites the Global Environment Facility (GEF), in line with its \\nexisting mandate, to consider channeling support to developing \\ncountries for the preparation and submission of their adaptation \\ncommunications; and\\n\\n•  encourages the GCF, GEF, Adaptation Fund, Climate \\nTechnology Centre and Network (CTCN), and Paris \\nCommittee on Capacity-building (PCCB), in line with \\ntheir existing mandates and governing instruments, to \\ncontinue channeling support to developing countries for \\nthe implementation of their adaptation plans and actions in \\naccordance with the priorities and needs outlined in their \\nadaptation communication.\\nThe annex to the decision contains elements of an adaptation \\n\\ncommunication.\\n\\nModalities, Procedures, and Guidelines for the \\n\\nTransparency Framework for Action and Support: Work \\nunder this item focused on developing common modalities, \\nprocedures, and guidelines (MPGs) for the transparency \\nframework established in Agreement Article 13. This item was \\ntaken up in informal consultations, co-facilitated by Andrew \\nRakestraw (US) and Xiang Gao (China), which met six times. \\nIn informal consultations, parties considered the Co-Facilitators’ \\nproposed organization of work, including the order in which \\nsections will be addressed and the use of “informal informal” \\ndiscussions to clarify core concerns, interests, and priorities. \\n\\nReporting back from informal informal discussions on \\n\\ntechnical principles, two country groups reported that parties \\nhad agreed to a conceptual approach to definitions that would \\nadequately address transparency and completeness across \\ndifferent sections of the presiding officers’ addendum. Another \\nparty reported that parties had agreed to work on refining \\noptions for the role of the Consultative Group of Experts \\n(CGE) in assisting developing countries’ implementation of the \\ntransparency guidelines. \\n\\nCo-Facilitator Rakestraw presented the first iteration of draft \\n\\ntext. He requested parties to identify “landing zones” on as \\nmany issues as possible. Many groups expressed concern that \\ntheir proposals had not been reflected, with two developing \\ncountry groups lamenting the absence of brackets around “shall” \\nin a section on the information necessary to track progress in \\nimplementing and achieving NDCs under Agreement Article 4 \\n(mitigation). Some suggested using in-text brackets consistently \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 9\\n\\nto indicate areas of disagreement. Two groups called for reflecting \\nthe special circumstances of LDCs and small island developing \\nstates (SIDS), with one calling for a “central group review \\nsystem” for the LDCs. Several groups and parties also identified \\nsections and paragraphs in which they wished to change text or \\ninsert brackets, or where they had reservations or objections. \\n\\nParties assigned areas for “homework” in informal informal \\n\\ndiscussions: \\n•  guidance to the GEF on support for developing countries’ \\n\\nreporting; \\n•  the CGE; \\n•  flexibility in different sections of the text; \\n•  referring to outputs from APA agenda item 3 (mitigation \\n\\nsection) discussions on ICTU; \\n\\n•  loss and damage; and \\n•  format of the technical expert review. \\n\\nOne group suggested adding Agreement Article 6 (cooperative \\n\\napproaches) to the list. Parties expressed concern throughout \\ninformal consultations that time was insufficient to address \\nall these areas and meet the deadlines assigned by the APA \\nCo-Chairs.\\n\\nCo-Facilitator Rakestraw invited parties’ views on the APA \\nCo-Chairs’ iteration of draft text. Parties accepted the text as \\nthe basis for further negotiations, but raised numerous concerns, \\nespecially on provisions for flexibility. The text was forwarded to \\nthe APA and later to the COP for further consideration.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations, co-facilitated by \\nTeresa Ribera Rodríguez, Minister for the Ecological Transition, \\nSpain, and Derek Andre Hanekom, Minister of Tourism, South \\nAfrica. During the presidency consultations, parties first identified \\nthe key issues, particularly flexibility and loss and damage.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.23), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia:\\n•  adopts the MPGs for the transparency framework for action \\n\\nand support contained in the annex;\\n\\n•  requests SBSTA to undertake the first review and update, \\n\\nas appropriate, the MPGs no later than 2028 on the basis of \\nexperience gained in reporting, technical expert review, and \\nfacilitative, multilateral consideration of progress, and decides \\nthat subsequent reviews and updates will be undertaken when \\nthe CMA determines them to be appropriate; \\n\\n•  decides that parties shall submit their first biennial \\n\\ntransparency report and national inventory report, if submitted \\nas a stand-alone report, in accordance with the modalities, \\nprocedures, and guidelines at the latest by 31 December 2024; \\n\\n•  decides that LDCs and SIDS may submit the information \\n\\nreferred to in Article 13, paragraphs 7 (inventories, progress \\ntoward NDCs), 8 (adaptation), 9 (means of implementation \\nprovided), and 10 (means of implementation received) at their \\ndiscretion;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat, in addition to the actions specified in \\n\\nthe MPGs, to: produce synthesis reports on parties’ biennial \\ntransparency reports and national inventory reports; produce \\nan annual report on the technical expert review; and publish \\nparties’ biennial transparency reports and national inventory \\nreports, if submitted as a stand-alone report, technical expert \\nreports, and the record of parties’ facilitative, multilateral \\nconsideration of progress on the UNFCCC website; \\n\\n•  urges and requests the GEF, as an operating entity of the \\n\\nfinancial mechanism, throughout its replenishment cycles to \\nsupport developing country parties in preparing their first and \\nsubsequent biennial transparency reports; \\n\\n•  urges the GEF and its implementing and executing agencies, \\n\\nand encourages the GEF Council, to consider options \\nfor improving the efficiency of the process for providing \\nsupport for reporting under Article 13, including through \\nbetter streamlining of the processes related to applications, \\nimplementation plans, and signing of grant agreements; \\n\\n•  requests the GEF to continue to support the operation of the \\n\\nCapacity-building Initiative for Transparency as a priority \\nreporting-related need; \\n\\n•  requests SBSTA to develop, pursuant to the MPGs for \\n\\nconsideration and adopting by CMA 3 (November 2020): \\ncommon reporting tables for the electronic reporting of the \\ninformation referred to in Chapter II, and common tabular \\nformats for the electronic reporting of the information referred \\nto in Chapters III, V, and VI of the annex, taking into account \\nthe existing common tabular formats and common reporting \\nformats; outlines of the biennial transparency report, national \\ninventory document, and technical expert report, pursuant to \\nthe MPGs contained in the annex; and a training programme \\nfor technical experts participating in the technical expert \\nreview; \\n\\n•  invites parties to submit their views on the work referred to \\n\\nabove via the submission portal by 31 March 2019; and\\n\\n•  decides that, subject to the extension of its terms by the COP, \\nthe CGE shall also serve the Paris Agreement, starting from 1 \\nJanuary 2019, to support the implementation of the enhanced \\ntransparency framework, inter alia: facilitating the provision \\nof technical advice and support to developing country parties, \\nas applicable, including for the preparation and submission of \\ntheir biennial transparency reports and facilitating improved \\nreporting over time; and providing technical advice to the \\nSecretariat on the implementation of the training of the \\ntechnical expert review teams referred to above. \\nThe annex contains the MPGs for the transparency framework, \\n\\nunder the following headings:\\n•  national inventory report of anthropogenic emissions by \\n\\nsources and removals by sinks of GHGs;\\n\\n•  methods;\\n•  metrics;\\n•  reporting guidance;\\n•  information necessary to track progress made in implementing \\nand achieving NDCs under Article 4 (mitigation) of the Paris \\nAgreement;\\n\\n•  information related to climate change impacts and adaptation \\n\\nunder Article 7 (adaptation) of the Paris Agreement; \\n\\n•  information on financial, technology development and \\n\\ntransfer, and capacity-building support provided and mobilized \\nunder Articles 9 (finance) and 11 (technology) of the Paris \\nAgreement; \\n\\n•  technical expert review; and\\n•  facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress.\\n\\nMatters relating to the global stocktake (GST): Discussions \\n\\nunder this item focused on identifying the sources of input \\nfor, and developing the modalities of, the GST established by \\nAgreement Article 14. There are two sub-items under this agenda \\nitem: identifying the sources of input for the GST and developing \\nmodalities for the GST. \\n\\nInformal consultations were co-facilitated by Kamal Djemouai \\n\\n(Algeria) and Outi Honkatukia (Finland), and parties met \\nextensively in “informal informal” settings. Parties worked \\nthrough three successive iterations of draft decision text. \\n\\nOn equity, some proposed that qualitative or quantitative inputs \\ninform how equity considerations are operationalized in the GST. \\nSome developed countries preferred an overarching principle \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cthat the GST should be conducted in light of equity, as well as \\nprovisions on inputs on equity. By contrast, some developing \\ncountries said equity should be included in each element of \\nthe GST. A developing country group presented proposals for \\nhow equity could be operationalized in information collection, \\ninputs to the technical assessment, and outputs of the technical \\nassessment. A developed country lamented that equity was not a \\ndefined concept and opposed inserting it throughout the text. \\nViews diverged on the timeline for the GST. A developing \\ncountry group stressed that the overall process should take no \\nmore than six months.\\n\\nViews also diverged on the participation of non-party \\n\\nstakeholders. One developing country group requested removing \\nreferences to participation of non-party stakeholders “throughout \\nthe process,” and, with several other countries, stressed that \\nnon-party stakeholders should have a separate forum in which to \\nparticipate. \\n\\nOn sources of input, a developing country group suggested, \\ninter alia, references to Agreement Articles 9.5 (ex ante finance \\ntransparency) and 9.7 (ex post finance transparency). A developed \\ncountry group noted that these possible sources of input to the \\nGST are under negotiation and suggested higher-level guidance \\non the GST given ongoing negotiations. The text was forwarded \\nto the APA and later to the COP for further consideration.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations co-facilitated by \\nDavid Paul, Minister of Environment and Minister-in-Assistance \\nto the President, Marshall Islands, and Carole Dieschbourg, \\nMinister of Environment, Luxembourg.\\n\\nParties exchanged views on: the scope of the GST; \\n\\nincorporating equity considerations; the role of non-party \\nstakeholders; sources of input; and whether loss and damage \\nshould be in a separate workstream under the technical dialogue, \\nor if it should be addressed under the adaptation workstream.\\nSome parties expressed concern that “bridging proposals,” \\n\\nwhich had been previously communicated to the Co-Facilitators \\nwere not reflected in the text, and said this language should be \\nincluded in the next iteration, highlighting the party-driven nature \\nof the process. Others said the mandate from the Presidency was \\nto work on solutions, rather than reinserting proposals “that are \\nincapable of attracting consensus.”\\n\\nSome parties expressed concern about the mode of work, \\nstating that the unresolved issues on scope and equity were \\npolitical rather than technical in nature. Others said that parties \\nshould continue to try and resolve these elements prior to \\nministerial engagement.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.16) the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  decides that equity and the best available science will be \\n\\nconsidered in a party-driven and cross-cutting manner, \\nthroughout the GST;\\n\\n•  decides that the GST will consist of the following components: \\n\\ninformation collection and preparation; technical assessment; \\nand consideration of outputs;\\n\\n•  decides that the GST will be conducted with the assistance of \\nthe SBSTA, which will establish a joint contact group on the \\nmatter;\\n\\n•  resolves to engage in a technical dialogue that aims to \\n\\nsupport the work of the joint contact group through expert \\nconsideration of inputs;\\n\\n•  decides to establish the technical dialogue, which will, \\n\\ninter alia, organize its work in line with taking stock of the \\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement to assess the collective \\nprogress towards achieving its purpose and long-term goals, \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 10\\n\\nin the thematic areas of mitigation, adaptation, and means \\nof implementation and support, noting that it may take into \\naccount efforts related to its work that address the social and \\neconomic consequences and impacts of response measures and \\navert, minimize and address loss and damage;\\n\\n•  requests the SBI and SBSTA Chairs to develop guiding \\n\\nquestions for all components of the GST;\\n\\n•  decides that the information collection and preparation \\n\\ncomponent will commence one session before the start of the \\ntechnical assessment, which will take place during the two or \\nthree successive sessions of the subsidiary bodies preceding \\nCMA 6 during which the consideration of outputs will take \\nplace;\\n\\n•  decides that the GST will be a party-driven process conducted \\nin a transparent manner and with the participation of non-party \\nstakeholders and that all inputs will be fully accessible by \\nparties, including online;\\n\\n•  emphasizes that the outputs of the GST should focus on taking \\n\\nstock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement to assess \\ncollective progress, have no individual party focus, and include \\nnon-policy prescriptive consideration of collective progress \\nthat parties can use to inform the updating and enhancing, in a \\nnationally determined manner, of their actions and support;\\n\\n•  invites parties to present their NDCs, informed by the outcome \\n\\nof the GST, at a special event under the auspices of the UN \\nSecretary-General; and\\n\\n•  decides that the consideration of outputs will consist of high-\\n\\nlevel events where the findings of the technical assessment will \\nbe presented, and their implications discussed and considered \\nby parties.\\nModalities and Procedures for the Effective Operation of \\n\\nthe Committee to Facilitate Implementation and Promote \\nCompliance: Agreement Article 15 establishes a mechanism, \\nconsisting of a committee, to facilitate implementation and \\npromote compliance with the provisions of the Agreement. \\nDiscussions under this item were concerned with developing \\nthe modalities and procedures for the effective operation of the \\ncommittee. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by Janine \\nFelson (Belize) and Christina Voigt (Norway) and met six times. \\nParties also met extensively in informal informal settings. In \\ninformal consultations, discussions largely focused on initiation \\nand process, institutional arrangements, and measures and \\noutputs. Parties worked through three successive iterations of \\ndraft decision text.\\n\\nOn initiation and process, parties discussed under what \\n\\ncircumstances the committee can initiate consideration of an \\nissue. Several developed countries said the committee should not \\nhave to decide whether or not a provision of the Paris Agreement \\nis legally binding before initiating consideration, because it is \\nnot a legal committee. Some parties strongly opposed initiation \\nby the committee for matters related to technical expert review \\nreports under the transparency framework. Many parties stressed \\nthe need for initiation beyond self-referral. Many said initiation \\nby the committee should not be subject to the consent of the party \\nconcerned, which one developing country group opposed. \\n\\nIn the text as forwarded to the COP, an option remained as \\nto whether to fully specify the circumstances under which the \\ncommittee may initiate consideration of issues, or to merely \\nprovide that the committee may initiate consideration of issues \\nrelated to a party’s implementation and compliance with \\n“mandatory provisions” of the Paris Agreement.\\n\\nOn measures and outputs, views diverged on whether \\nto include a list of specific elements that the committee \\nmust consider in deciding measures and outputs, including, \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 11\\n\\namong others, force majeure and LDCs’ and SIDS’ special \\ncircumstances. Several developed countries preferred to provide \\nthat the committee shall take into account the national capabilities \\nand circumstances of the party concerned, and suggested that \\nthis broad “catch-all” phrasing would cover the more specific \\nproposals in the text. Several developing country groups urged \\nretaining specific elements. The text, as forwarded to the \\nCOP, includes the catch-all language, as well as the special \\ncircumstances of LDCs and SIDS and force majeure.\\n\\nViews also diverged on whether the committee’s consideration \\n\\nof measures and outputs should vary by the legal nature of the \\nAgreement’s provisions concerned. Several countries urged a \\nsingle “toolbox” of measures and outputs, while others preferred \\na subset of measures for legally binding provisions.\\n\\nOn institutional arrangements, parties differed as to whether \\n\\nmeetings of the committee should be public. Many parties \\npreferred that meetings of the committee be public by default, \\nopposed by one developing country group. Views also diverged \\non whether to specify balance between developed and developing \\ncountries for the committee’s co-chairs.\\n\\nSeveral groups suggested that committee members be \\n\\nnominated at CMA 1, rather than at CMA 2, as set out in the draft \\ntext, to allow the committee to begin its work as soon as possible. \\nA developing country group opposed, expressing concern that \\nregional groups would not be able to coordinate quickly enough. \\nThe text forwarded to the COP provided for elections at CMA 2.\\n\\nViews diverged on flexibility in timelines. Developing \\n\\ncountries supported language providing flexibility in timelines for \\ndeveloping countries. Developed countries said flexibility should \\napply in light of countries’ national capacities and circumstances. \\nThe text was forwarded to the APA and later the COP.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations, co-facilitated by \\nFelson and Voight, and later by a member of the COP Presidency. \\nDiscussions focused on measures, initiation by the committee, \\nand flexibility on the timelines.\\n\\nOn measures, parties considered a textual proposal that would, \\ninter alia, provide that the committee may issue “findings of fact” \\nin relation to implementation and compliance with the provisions \\nof the Paris Agreement, except in cases related to technical expert \\nreview reports under the transparency framework. Parties could \\nnot agree to this proposal. One party said that the committee \\nshould only be able to issue “findings of fact” in relation to binary \\nlegally-binding obligations. Other parties expressed concerns \\nabout a subparagraph under which the committee may facilitate a \\ndialogue between the party concerned and the appropriate finance, \\ntechnology, and capacity-building bodies or arrangements, in \\norder to identify possible challenges and solutions. Many parties \\nexpressed a willingness to engage further on the proposal, while \\none group called for an immediate compromise, expressing \\nuncertainty about the value of further discussions.\\n\\nOn committee initiation, parties considered how to reflect that \\nthe committee should consider only whether a communication had \\nbeen made, rather than the content of the information provided.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.5), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  adopts the modalities and procedures for the effective \\n\\noperation of the implementation and compliance committee \\ncontained in an annex to the decision; and\\n\\n•  decides to undertake the first review of the modalities and \\n\\nprocedures at CMA 7, on the basis of the experience gained \\nwith their implementation and taking into account any \\nrecommendations of the committee, and to consider conducting \\nfurther reviews on a regular basis.\\n\\nAnnexed to the decision are the modalities and procedures that \\n\\ncontain sections on: purpose, principles, nature, functions, and \\nscope; institutional arrangements; initiation and process; measures \\nand outputs; consideration of systemic issues; information; \\nrelationship with the CMA; and Secretariat.\\n\\nFurther matters relating to the Adaptation Fund: \\nDiscussions under this item focused on elaborating the \\ngovernance and institutional arrangements, safeguards, and \\noperating modalities for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris \\nAgreement. Informal consultations were co-facilitated by María \\ndel Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Pieter Terpstra (Netherlands). \\nParties discussed the type of guidance the CMA is to provide to \\nthe Adaptation Fund Board (AFB), the operating modalities of the \\nFund, and sources of and eligibility for funding. \\n\\nOn the type of guidance, some parties favored a clear list of \\nactivities, others wished to see a few specific issues addressed, \\nand others did not consider a list of activities necessary. A \\ndeveloping country group proposed three general “clusters” \\nof guidance to the AFB: purpose, governance, and resource \\nmobilization. Three options for changes to the operating \\nmodalities and safeguards of the Adaptation Fund were discussed: \\nno change to modalities, consideration of the need to change, or \\nreview and consideration of possible changes. \\n\\nOn operating modalities, parties disagreed on whether the COP \\nshould designate the Adaptation Fund as an operating entity of the \\nFinancial Mechanism of the Convention. Two country groups said \\nthey would work together to propose language on arrangements \\nfor sharing lessons from the Adaptation Fund relevant for other \\nfunds, such as the GCF or LDC Fund, and some proposed \\ndrawing on language from the operational framework of the GCF. \\nOne country group expressed concern that using language from \\nthe GCF would risk the Adaptation Fund becoming “mitigation-\\ncentric,” to which another country group clarified that the \\nlanguage would be generic and not specific to the GCF. \\n\\nOn sources of funding, parties disagreed about whether \\nthe Adaptation Fund should accept support from “other” or \\n“innovative” funding sources. A developing country suggested \\ninserting a placeholder designation that “x percentage” of \\nthe share of proceeds from the Agreement Article 6.4 market \\nmechanism should go to the Fund. \\n\\nParties raised issues with the first iteration of the draft text. \\nA developing country group said its views were not accurately \\nreflected in revised text on the type of guidance the CMA should \\nprovide to the AFB. A developed country said the same text failed \\nto capture components it deemed essential, and proposed new \\nstreamlined text. Two countries proposed bracketing paragraphs \\nthat refer to the Agreement Article 6.4 mechanism, as Article 6 \\ndiscussions were ongoing. A developing country reiterated that it \\nwould not accept references to “innovative” sources of finance. \\n\\nOn eligibility for funding, parties diverged on their preferences \\n\\nfor options. They discussed the need to recognize the special \\ncircumstances of LDCs and SIDS, and challenges in defining \\nwhich countries are “particularly vulnerable.” A developing \\ncountry group proposed bracketing the entire section on \\neligibility, arguing that it is clearly defined under the CMP and \\ndoes not require changes. \\n\\nOn the composition of the AFB, parties’ views strongly \\n\\ndiverged. A developed country group and a developed country \\nurged a COP 24 decision to review the composition of the \\nboard. They cited the need for clarity on AFB arrangements \\nduring a potential transitional period and potential changes in \\nfunding sources, respectively. Several groups opposed, with one \\nsuggesting the section on board composition be deleted. The text \\nwas forwarded to the APA and then the COP\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cThe COP convened presidency consultations on this issue, in \\nconjunction with other matters related to finance, co-facilitated \\nby Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment, Egypt, and \\nJochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the \\nEnvironment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany.\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision. The \\n\\nCMP also adopted a procedural decision on this issue.\\n\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.11), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia: decides that the Adaptation Fund shall serve the \\nParis Agreement under the guidance of, and be accountable to, the \\nCMA with respect to all matters relating to the Paris Agreement, \\neffective 1 January 2019, subject to the decision on this matter \\nmade by the CMP.\\n\\nIn its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2018/L.4), the CMP adopted \\nthe same procedural decision recognizing when the Adaptation \\nFund will begin to serve the Paris Agreement.\\n\\nFurther matters except the Adaptation Fund: This item \\nwas discussed in informal consultations, co-facilitated by APA \\nCo-Chairs Tyndall and Baashan, which met four times. In \\naddition, parties met informally throughout the first week. In the \\ninformal consultations, parties focused on, first, the presiding \\nofficers’ addendum and, later, iterations of the text prepared by \\nthe Co-Facilitators, containing text on five possible additional \\nmatters: \\n•  modalities for communicating finance information in \\n\\naccordance with Agreement Article 9.5 (ex ante finance \\ntransparency); \\n\\n•  initial guidance by the CMA operating entities of the Financial \\n\\nMechanism; \\n\\n•  initial guidance by the CMA to the LDC Fund and the SCCF; \\n•  guidance by the CMA on the adjustment of existing NDCs; and \\n•  setting a new collective quantified goal on finance.\\n\\nModalities for communicating information related to Article \\n\\n9.5: On 4 December, delegates noted a lack of progress at the \\ntechnical level and agreed on the need to move consultations to \\nheads of delegation level. On 5 December, Co-Chair Baashan \\nexplained that the topic had been discussed in a heads of \\ndelegation meeting and identified the need to provide assurances \\nof continuity and predictability of finance, while leaving countries \\nreporting information the ability to decide the level of information \\nthey are able to provide. Several groups and countries indicated \\nwillingness to engage in discussions on “procedures” or “practical \\narrangements,” with developed countries supporting discussing \\nthese under the SBI item on Paris Agreement Article 9.5 and, \\nopposed by one developing country group, closing discussions on \\nthis issue under the APA. Developed countries said they would \\nsupport discussions on the condition that a paragraph contained \\nin the presiding officers’ addendum on initiating a “facilitative \\nmultilateral consideration of progress and technical expert review \\nof information provided and reported” be omitted. In subsequent \\nconsultations, parties agreed that this item would remain “parked” \\npending discussions on Article 9.5 under the SBI.\\n\\nThe text was forwarded to the APA, then to the COP for \\n\\nconsideration.\\n\\nThis item was taken up in presidency consultations on matters \\n\\nrelated to finance, co-facilitated by Yasmine Fouad, Minister of \\nEnvironment, Egypt, and Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the \\nFederal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and \\nNuclear Safety, Germany.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted the decision on \\n\\nthis matter.\\n\\nCMA: \\n\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.15), the \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 12\\n\\n•  reiterates that countries shall biennially communicate \\n\\nindicative quantitative and qualitative information related to \\nAgreement Articles 9.1 (developed countries shall provide \\nfinancial resources) and 9.3 (developed countries should \\ncontinue to take the lead), as applicable, including, as \\navailable, projected levels of public financial resources to \\nbe provided to developing countries, and requests developed \\ncountries to submit the biennial communications as specified in \\nan annex to the decision starting in 2020;\\n\\n•  other parties providing resources are encouraged to \\n\\ncommunicate biennially such information on a voluntary basis; \\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to establish a dedicated online portal \\n\\nfor posting and recording the biennial communications;\\n\\n•  also requests the Secretariat to prepare a compilation \\n\\nand synthesis of the information included in the biennial \\ncommunications starting in 2021, with a view to informing the \\nGST;\\n\\n•  further requests the Secretariat to organize biennial in-session \\nworkshops beginning the year after the submission of the first \\nbiennial communications and to prepare a summary report on \\neach workshop;\\n\\n•  decides to consider the compilations and syntheses, and the \\n\\nsummary report on the in-session workshops, starting at CMA \\n4 (2021);\\n\\n•  also decides to convene a biennial high-level ministerial \\n\\ndialogue on climate finance beginning in 2021, to be informed, \\ninter alia, by the summary reports on the in-session workshops \\non the biennial communications;\\n\\n•  requests the CMA President to summarize the deliberations of \\n\\nthe ministerial dialogue for consideration by the CMA at its \\nsucceeding sessions;\\n\\n•  invites the COP to consider the compilations and syntheses, \\n\\nand the summary reports on the in-session workshops; and\\n\\n•  decides to consider updating the types of information contained \\n\\nin the annex to the decision at CMA 6 (2023) on the basis \\nof the experiences and lessons learned by parties in the \\npreparation of their biennial communications of indicative \\nquantitative and qualitative information.\\nGuidance related to the operating entities of the Financial \\n\\nMechanism: Parties agreed to confirm that the Standing \\nCommittee on Finance (SCF) shall serve the Paris Agreement. \\nOn a date for the SCF to start preparing draft guidance to the \\noperating entities, parties taking the floor agreed that this is \\ncovered by Paris decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 61 (CMA’s provision \\nof guidance to the Financial Mechanism operating entities).\\nGuidance to the LDCF and SCCF: Regarding the time \\n\\nframe for preparing the guidance, two groups spoke, expressing \\nflexibility to have no text. One developing country group \\npreferred to reiterate a mandate for at least the LDCF to start \\nserving the Paris Agreement.\\n\\nGuidance on the adjustment of existing NDCs: some \\n\\ndeveloped countries supported, while one developed and one \\ndeveloping country opposed, having a decision on this matter. \\nWhile parties agreed to “park” this item to give priority to \\nadvancing the PAWP, they disagreed on whether and when \\nto address the proposal, with several developed countries \\nemphasizing the need to clarify the process for adjusting NDCs \\nbefore CMA 3 (2020).\\n\\nSetting a new collective goal on finance: Developing and \\n\\ndeveloped countries’ views diverged on whether or not to indicate \\na starting point for a process to set the goal. Developing countries \\nstressed the need for clarity, predictability, progression, and a \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 13\\n\\ncollective process. Developed countries stated, inter alia, that \\nsuch a process is beyond the mandate of the PAWP and therefore \\npremature to discuss at COP 24.\\n\\nThe COP discussed this issue in presidency consultations \\n\\nco-facilitated by Ministers Fouad and Flasbarth. \\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision on setting a new collective quantified goal on \\n\\nfinance: In its decision (FCCC/PA/CMA/2018/L.3), the CMA:\\n•  decides to initiate at CMA 3 (November 2020), in accordance \\n\\nwith Agreement Article 9.3 (developed countries should \\ncontinue to take the lead), deliberations on setting a new \\ncollective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per \\nyear; and \\n\\n•  agrees to consider, in its deliberations referred to above, the \\naim to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate \\nchange in the context of sustainable development and efforts \\nto eradicate poverty, including by making finance flows \\nconsistent with a pathway towards low-GHG and climate-\\nresilient development.\\nAPA Contact Group Meeting: During its final contact group \\nmeeting on 8 December, the APA adopted its conclusions (FCCC/\\nAPA/2018/L.6).\\n\\nCo-facilitators reported on the progress achieved over the \\n\\nweek.\\n\\nOn guidance on the mitigation section of decision 1/CP.21 \\n\\n(Paris outcome), Sin Ling Cheah reported that the third iteration \\nof text could serve as a basis for work in the second week.\\n\\nOn adaptation communication, Beth Lavender reported that \\n\\nthree iterations had been developed.\\n\\nOn the transparency framework, Andrew Rakestraw reported \\n\\nthat three iterations were completed and thanked co-facilitators of \\nlinked issues for their coordination.\\n\\nOn the GST, Outi Honkatukia reported that positions were \\n\\n“not close enough” on a limited number of issues and said that, \\nwhile the third iteration is a good reflection of the group’s work, \\nthe Co-Facilitators’ notes from their final informal consultations \\nwould be forwarded to the APA Co-Chairs to inform possible \\nfuture work.\\n\\nOn the implementation and compliance committee, Janine \\n\\nFelson characterized the third iteration as significantly \\nstreamlined and providing fertile ground for finding solutions.\\n\\nOn the Adaptation Fund, María del Pilar Bueno reported that \\n\\nsome parties shared strong concerns about the way forward.\\nOn possible additional matters, APA Co-Chair Baashan \\n\\nreported that parties had worked through all five possible matters \\nand an in-session submission on loss and damage.\\n\\nParties then reflected on the work under each agenda item.\\nOn guidance on the mitigation section of decision 1/CP.21, \\n\\nGabon, for the African Group, and Maldives for AOSIS, opposed \\nreferences to the land sector and called for guidance to ensure \\nenvironmental integrity and prevent double counting under \\nAgreement Article 6 (cooperative approaches).\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, said that guidance on \\n\\nfeatures and accounting should be concise, bottom-up, and non-\\nprescriptive, and that NDCs are “full scope.” Australia, for the \\nUmbrella Group, expressed concern over bifurcation and scope, \\nas well as the “degree of legal bindingness” reflected in the text. \\nColombia, for AILAC, called for guidance that recognizes the \\nnationally-determined nature of NDCs as the “operationalization \\nof differentiation itself.” Switzerland, for the EIG, suggested that \\ninformation could be specific to the NDC type. Ethiopia, for the \\nLDCs, called for the inclusion of capacity-building support for \\nNDCs.\\n\\nOn adaptation communication, AILAC called for clear \\n\\nguidance to enhance adaptation actions. The EIG expressed \\nconcern that parties can choose information to be communicated \\nas a component of an NDC.\\n\\nOn transparency, the African Group raised concerns about \\n\\nbrackets around “flexibility options,” stressed tracking progress \\non all elements of the NDCs, and, with AOSIS, called for \\nguidance on reporting loss and damage. AOSIS said flexibility \\nshould be expressed in the individual provisions of the modalities, \\nprocedures, and guidance. The LDCs called for recognition of the \\nspecial circumstances of LDCs and SIDS and said the adaptation \\nsection requires more elaboration. \\n\\nThe Umbrella Group expressed concern about bifurcation \\nrelated to review and stressed the need for specific flexibility \\nprovisions to have an end date. The Arab Group opposed linkages \\nto the compliance mechanism.\\n\\nOn the GST, the African Group stressed the need to \\n\\noperationalize equity. AOSIS called for including loss and \\ndamage. The Arab Group lamented that the text does not \\nsufficiently reflect response measures and adaptation actions or \\neconomic diversification plans with mitigation co-benefits.\\n\\nThe LDCs and AOSIS underscored the need to recognize the \\n\\nspecial circumstances of LDCs and SIDS.\\n\\nThe EIG expressed disappointment that so many issues remain \\n\\nopen.\\n\\nOn compliance, AOSIS stressed the need for initiation beyond \\na self-trigger or a committee trigger based on the party’s consent. \\nAILAC cited the linkages with the transparency framework, \\nkeeping in mind the facilitative nature of the compliance \\nmechanism.\\n\\nThe EIG opposed a link to response measures.\\nOn the Adaptation Fund, the African Group underlined that he \\ncould not accept the current text. The Umbrella Group expressed \\nconcerns on the way equity is reflected in the current text.\\n\\nThe EIG underlined that Board membership should be equally \\n\\nshared between developed and developing countries and that \\npublic and private funding will be voluntary.\\n\\nThe EU suggested, as a way forward, to continue to use a \\n\\n“multi-layered approach,” namely separating issues that can be \\nsolved at a technical level from those that need political attention, \\nnoting that this had enabled progress so far.\\n\\nAPA Co-Chair Tyndall then introduced the draft APA \\n\\nconclusions, proposing to forward the text to the COP so that \\nthe COP Presidency could determine next steps. Noting the \\nAfrican Group’s statement that it could not accept the text on \\nthe Adaptation Fund, she proposed options on the way forward: \\nforwarding no text to the COP; reverting to the first iteration of \\nthe text; or using the present text prepared under the Co-Chairs’ \\nresponsibility, while identifying clearly that it did not represent \\nagreed text.\\n\\nThe African Group requested amending the draft conclusions \\nto reflect that it is the APA Co-Chairs’ proposals, rather than the \\n“outcome of work,” which are being forwarded to the COP, and \\nthat this is without prejudice to the content and form of the final \\noutcome of the PAWP. Parties accepted this and another, minor \\namendment.\\n\\nClosing Plenary: In plenary, the APA adopted its draft \\n\\nconclusions as amended in the contact group, and its draft report \\n(FCCC/APA/2018/L.5). \\n\\nFinal Outcome: In its conclusions (FCCC/APA/2018/L.6), \\nthe APA agreed to forward the proposals by its Co-Chairs on \\nthe PAWP, as presented in an annex. The proposals were being \\nforwarded for consideration by COP 24 without prejudice to \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cthe content and form of the final outcome of the PAWP and \\nrecognizing that further work by the COP was necessary to \\nfinalize the PAWP outcome.\\n\\nSubsidiary Body for Implementation\\n\\nSBI 49 convened from 2-8 December, when it adopted its \\nconclusions. On Saturday, 8 December, SBI Chair Emmanuel \\nDlamini (eSwatini) forwarded the proposed text to the COP, \\nwhere it was taken up in presidency consultations and at the \\nministerial level. Unless otherwise mentioned, on Saturday, 15 \\nDecember, the COP adopted decisions to be forwarded to the \\nCMA as part of the Katowice Climate Package. \\n\\nCommon Time Frames: Discussions on this item focused on \\nthe common frequency by which parties update or communicate \\ntheir NDCs. Currently, those parties with a five-year NDC are \\nrequested to communicate by 2020 a new NDC and those parties \\nwith a ten-year NDC are requested to communicate or update \\ntheir NDC by 2020. Agreement Article 4.10 requires common \\ntimeframes for NDCs to be considered. This item was taken up \\nby the SBI during its opening plenary and forwarded to informal \\nconsultations, which convened three times. Parties also met \\ninformally.\\n\\nIn the informal consultations, co-facilitated by Marianne \\n\\nKarlsen (Norway) and George Wamukoya (Kenya), discussions \\ncentered on the presiding officers’ addendum and text proposed \\nby the Co-Facilitators. Parties expressed different preferences \\nregarding common time frames, including five, ten, five or \\nten, and “five plus five.” Views differed on whether or not to \\nfinalize discussions in Katowice, with some suggesting providing \\nguidance to the next round of NDCs only and mandating the SBI \\nto consider communications from 2031 onwards. Some groups \\nand parties called for the removal of paragraphs referring to the \\noutcomes of the GST and content or scope of NDCs. \\n\\nA developing country group proposed text that builds on the \\n\\nfirst round of submissions in 2015 and on paragraphs 23 and \\n24 of the Paris outcome (1/CP.21) relating to communicating or \\nupdating NDCs, explaining it reflected these paragraphs and also \\ncontained a request to the SBI to consider common NDC time \\nframes to be implemented from 2041 onwards. Others suggested \\nmandating the SBI to consider common time frames to be \\nimplemented from 2031 onwards.\\n\\nNoting that an agreement on common time frames would \\nbe unlikely in Katowice, several parties supported procedural \\nconclusions on this item from SBI 49 and capturing progress \\nmade so far either in conclusions text, an annex, an addendum, or \\na separate document referred to in a footnote of the conclusions.\\nInformal consultations continued on 8 December, and parties \\n\\nagreed to a draft COP decision.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2018/L.27), the \\n\\nCMA: \\n•  welcomes the progress made in the consideration of common \\ntime frames for NDCs and takes note of the rich exchange of \\nviews and range of options considered and proposed by parties \\non this matter;\\n\\n•  decides that parties shall apply common time frames to their \\n\\nNDCs to be implemented from 2031 onward; and\\n\\n•  requests SBI 50 to continue the consideration of common time \\n\\nframes for NDCs with a view to making a recommendation \\nthereon for consideration and adoption by the CMA.\\nModalities and Procedures for the Operation and Use \\nof a Public Registry referred to in Agreement Article 4.12 \\n(NDCs): Agreement Article 4.12 states that NDCs shall be \\nrecorded in a public registry maintained by the Secretariat. \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 14\\n\\nDiscussions under this item focused on developing modalities \\nand procedures for the registry’s operation and use. This item was \\ntaken up by the SBI during its opening plenary and forwarded to \\ninformal consultations, which convened five times. Parties also \\nmet informally. In the informal consultations, co-facilitated by \\nPeter Wittoeck (Belgium) and Emily Massawa (The Gambia), \\ndiscussions focused on the presiding officers’ addendum and text \\niterations prepared by the Co-Facilitators.\\n\\nParties expressed preferences among three options contained \\nin the main decision text: two options referring to adopting the \\nmodalities and procedures for the registry’s operation; and one \\nto not adopt specific modalities and procedures. One developing \\ncountry group suggested “running a prototype registry,” noting \\nthat once parties see how this prototype functions, they could \\npropose its adoption by CMA 2. \\n\\nParties expressed diverging views on: removal of the registry’s \\n\\nsearch function; and whether there should be one or two \\nregistries, with some proposing having one portal with access to \\ntwo registries. A developing country group proposed adding text \\non “one registry with two sections, one for NDCs and one for \\nadaptation communication.” \\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.8), the \\n\\nCMA:\\n•  adopts the modalities and procedures for the operation and use \\nof a public registry for Agreement Article 4.12 as referred to in \\nthe annex;\\n\\n•  decides that the interim public registry shall serve as the \\n\\npublic registry referred to in Agreement Article 4.12 following \\nany revisions required to bring it into accordance with the \\nmodalities and procedures in the guidance;\\n\\n•  decides that the public registry shall be made available by the \\n\\nSecretariat through a registry with two parts, comprising NDCs \\nand adaptation communications, respectively;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to develop a prototype by June 2019 \\n\\nand to operate the public registry;\\n\\n•  decides to consider and conclude at CMA 2 whether the \\nprototype conforms to the modalities and procedures; and\\n\\n•  decides the interim registry shall continue to be used on an \\n\\ninterim basis.\\nModalities and Procedures for the Operation and Use \\n\\nof a Public Registry referred to in Agreement Article \\n7.12 (Adaptation Communication): Discussions under this \\nitem focused on developing modalities and procedures for \\nthe operation and use of the public registry where adaptation \\ncommunication shall be recorded under Agreement Article \\n7.12. This item was taken up by the SBI in its opening plenary \\nand forwarded to informal consultations, which convened five \\ntimes. Parties also met informally. In the informal consultations, \\nco-facilitated by Emily Massawa and Peter Wittoeck, parties \\ndiscussed the presiding officers’ addendum and text prepared by \\nthe Co-Facilitators.\\n\\nParties diverged on whether to have one or two registries. \\n\\nSome groups and countries requested bringing back their \\npreferred options from the Bangkok outcome, including a registry \\nfor adaptation communication with hyperlinks to where these \\ncan be found and having a single registry with two parts. One \\ndeveloping country group requested holding a joint meeting at \\nSBI 49 with the NDC registry item, which many opposed.\\nOn 15 December the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.9), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  decides to establish a registry for adaptation communications;\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 15\\n\\n•  decides to adopt the modalities and procedures for the \\n\\noperation and use of the registry in the annex of the decision;\\n\\n•  further decides that the public registry shall be made \\n\\navailable by the Secretariat, together with the public registry \\nfor Article 4.12 (NDCs) through a registry portal with two \\nparts, comprising adaptation communications and nationally \\ndetermined contributions, respectively; \\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to: develop a prototype by June 2019 \\n\\nand to operate the public registry; and\\n\\n•  decides to consider and conclude at CMA 2 whether the \\n\\nprototype conforms to the modalities and procedures.\\nResponse Measures: Modalities, work programme, and \\nfunctions under the Paris Agreement: Discussions under this \\nitem are focused on elaborating the modalities, work programme \\nand functions of the forum on the impacts of the implementation \\nof response measures under the Paris Agreement. This joint SBI \\nand SBSTA item was first taken up in plenary and subsequently \\naddressed throughout the week in a contact group co-chaired \\nby the SBI Chair Emmanuel Dlamini (eSwatini) and SBSTA \\nChair Paul Watkinson (France), and in informal consultations \\nco-facilitated by Andrei Marcu (Belize) and Keith Anderson \\n(Switzerland). \\n\\nParties accepted the presiding officers’ addendum as a basis \\n\\nfor further negotiations. During discussions, views diverged, inter \\nalia, on whether: the areas of work should include elements other \\nthan just transition and economic diversification; intersessional \\nworkshops are needed; and to establish a permanent executive \\ncommittee. \\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations on this issue, \\n\\nco-facilitated by Andrei Marcu and Keith Anderson. Discussions \\nfocused on a draft CMA decision including elements of \\nmodalities, work programme, and functions under the Paris \\nAgreement of the forum on the impact of the implementation of \\nresponse measures.\\n\\nOn the work programme, some parties asked for broadening \\nthe scope and for a sequential assessment of response measures \\nand, when these are found to have negative impacts, to \\nrecommend actions to prevent such negative impacts from \\nreoccurring.\\n\\nSome stressed the need for tools, capacity building, and \\n\\nawareness on response measures, while others cautioned against \\nincluding too much detail or specifying tools such as economic \\nmodelling. On governance, one party suggested that a “Katowice \\nCommittee on the Impacts of Implementation of Response \\nMeasures” could implement the work programme of the forum. \\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision, (FCCC/CP/2018/L.17), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  decides that the forum on the impact of the implementation of \\nresponse measures (hereinafter referred to as the forum) under \\nthe Subsidiary Bodies (SBs) shall serve the Paris Agreement in \\nrelation to matters under the Paris Agreement; \\n\\n•  adopts the modalities, work programme, and functions of the \\n\\nforum contained in the annex; \\n\\n•  acknowledges that there is one single forum that covers the \\n\\nwork of the COP, CMP, and CMA on all matters relating to the \\nimpact of the implementation of response measures; \\n\\n•  affirms that the forum shall report to the CMA with respect \\n\\nto matters falling under Agreement Article 4.15 (parties shall \\ntake into consideration concerns of parties most impacted by \\nresponse measures), where the forum requires the guidance of \\nthe CMA; \\n\\n•  decides to establish a Katowice Committee of Experts on \\nthe Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures \\nto support the work of the forum on the impact of the \\nimplementation of response measures, and to operate in \\naccordance with the terms of reference contained in the annex; \\n\\n•  requests SBs 59 (November 2023) to consider the functions, \\nwork programme, and modalities of the forum, with a view \\nto providing recommendations for consideration by COP 29, \\nCMP 19, and CMA 6 (November 2023); \\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to organize the first meeting of the \\nKatowice Committee of Experts to be held for two days, in \\nconjunction with SB 50; \\n\\n•  invites parties to nominate members to serve on the Katowice \\nCommittee of Experts, noting that the Chairs of the SBs shall \\nbe notified of these appointments by 15 April 2019; \\n\\n•  decides that the forum shall develop and recommend a six-year \\nworkplan in line with the forum’s functions, work programme, \\nand modalities, taking into account relevant policy issues \\nof concern to parties, for consideration and adoption by the \\nsubsidiary bodies at their fiftieth sessions; \\n\\n•  requests the SBs to conduct a midterm review of the workplan \\nof the forum, starting from SB 56 (June 2022), with a view to \\nenhancing the effectiveness of the forum; \\n\\n•  invites parties to submit their views on the workplan of \\n\\nthe forum and its Katowice Committee of Experts via the \\nsubmission portal by 15 April 2019; \\n\\n•  decides that the forum on the impact of the implementation \\n\\nof response measures shall provide recommendations for \\nconsideration by the SBs with a view to the subsidiary bodies \\nrecommending actions to the COP, CMP, and CMA for \\nconsideration and adoption; \\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to support the implementation of \\n\\nthe work programme of the forum on the impact of the \\nimplementation of response measures; \\n\\n•  takes note of the estimated budgetary implications of the \\n\\nactivities to be undertaken by the Secretariat; and\\n\\n•  requests that the actions of the Secretariat called for in this \\n\\ndecision be undertaken subject to the availability of financial \\nresources. \\nThe annex to the decision includes three parts on functions, \\n\\nwork programme, and modalities.\\n\\nReport of the Adaptation Committee and Matters relating \\n\\nto the LDCs, referred to in paragraphs 41, 42, and 45 of \\ndecision 1/CP.21: Discussions under these items focused on \\nrequests to the Adaptation Committee regarding the nature and \\nsubstance of its reporting and workplan, and on various issues \\nof importance to LDCs, including financial support, capacity \\nbuilding, and the LDC Expert Group. These items were first \\ntaken up on 2 December in the COP plenary, then referred to joint \\nSBSTA/SBI informal consultations to discuss paragraphs 41, 42, \\nand 45 of decision 1/CP.21, as mandated to Adaptation Committee \\nand the LDC Expert Group (LEG). Informal consultations were \\nco-facilitated by Pepetua Latasi (Tuvalu) and Malcolm Ridout \\n(UK).\\n\\n On ways to enhance the coherence of the work of adaptation-\\n\\nrelated institutional arrangements, discussions centered on: \\n•  encouraging or requesting institutional arrangements to \\n\\nstrive for a balance between adaptation and mitigation, with \\ndeveloping countries cautioning against backsliding; \\n\\n•  requesting the CGE and LEG to work together on training for \\n\\nassessing vulnerability and other aspects of adaptation; and \\n•  who should be encouraged to provide resources for the work \\n\\nof adaptation-related institutions, with some developed country \\nparties supporting a broad formulation. \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cthe Paris Agreement;\\n\\n•  invites the CGE and LEG, in line with their mandates, as \\nappropriate, ensuring efficiency and consistency, to work \\ntogether on training for assessing vulnerability and other \\naspects of adaptation;\\n\\nDelegates also discussed methodologies on reviewing the \\n\\nadequacy and effectiveness of adaptation and support. \\n\\nThese discussions continued in presidency consultations on \\nadaptation, co-facilitated by Kimmo Tiilikainen, Minister of the \\nEnvironment, Energy and Housing, Finland, and Lamin Dibba, \\nMinister of Environment, Climate Change and Natural Resources, \\nThe Gambia. Disagreement remained, inter alia, regarding: \\n•  which parties should be encouraged to provide resources \\nfor the implementation of the work of adaptation-related \\ninstitutions under the Convention and the Paris Agreement; \\n\\n•  who should be requested to develop, and regularly update, an \\ninventory of relevant methodologies for assessing adaptation \\nneeds; and \\n\\n•  options for requesting SBSTA to consider ways to improve the \\napplicability of such methodologies, and the role of the IPCC \\nin that process.\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.14), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  decides that the Adaptation Committee and the LEG shall serve \\n\\n•  urges developed countries and invites other parties that provide \\n\\nresources on a voluntary basis to make available sufficient \\nresources for the successful and timely implementation of the \\nwork of adaptation-related institutions under the Convention \\nand the Agreement;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to include in the synthesis report \\n\\nprepared for the GST information on the adaptation efforts \\nof developing countries, in order to facilitate recognition of \\nsuch efforts in the GST, drawing on, inter alia, the most recent \\ndocuments that may contain adaptation information, which \\nmay include adaptation communications, NAPs, national \\ncommunications, NDCs, other relevant reports prepared under \\nthe transparency framework and reports of the IPCC and other \\nrelevant scientific bodies;\\n\\n•  decides to recognize, guided by the high-level committee and \\ntaking into account a country-driven approach, the adaptation \\nefforts of developing countries during the high-level events of \\nthe GST;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to prepare a report summarizing the \\n\\nrecognition of adaptation efforts of developing countries \\ndrawing on, inter alia, the synthesis report and outputs;\\n\\n•  requests the Adaptation Committee, in collaboration with the \\nLEG, partner organizations of the Nairobi Work Programme, \\nusers and developers of relevant methodologies, including \\nacademia and the private sector, to develop by June 2020 and \\nto regularly update an inventory of relevant methodologies for \\nassessing adaptation needs;\\n\\n•  requests the Adaptation Committee with the engagement of \\nIPCC Working Group II, as appropriate, to prepare, drawing \\non the inventory and the submissions by parties on the \\ndevelopment and application of methodologies for assessing \\nadaptation needs, a technical paper on methodologies for \\nassessing adaptation needs and their application, as well \\nas on the related gaps, good practices, lessons learned, and \\nguidelines, for consideration and further guidance by SBSTA \\n57 (November 2022);\\n\\n•  invites the SCF, in line with its mandate and in collaboration \\nwith the TEC and the PCCB, to consider, taking into account \\nthe recommendations of the Adaptation Committee and the \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 16\\n\\nLEG, as well as relevant submissions from parties and observer \\norganizations, ways to facilitate the mobilization of support for \\nadaptation in developing countries;\\n\\n•  requests parties to report on support provided and received \\nin line with the reporting instruments and modalities being \\ndeveloped under the Agreement; and\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to include in the synthesis report \\n\\nprepared for the GST an assessment of the support needs for \\nadaptation of developing countries.\\nMatters Relating to Climate Finance: Identification of \\ninformation to be provided in accordance with Agreement \\nArticle 9.5 (ex ante finance transparency): Discussions under \\nthis item were concerned with identifying the information to \\nbe provided under Agreement Article 9.5. Under this article, \\ndeveloped country parties shall biennially communicate indicative \\nquantitative and qualitative information related to Agreement \\nArticles 9.1 and 9.3, which provide that:\\n•  developed country parties shall provide financial resources \\n\\nto assist developing country parties with respect to both \\nmitigation and adaptation; and\\n\\n•  developed country parties should continue to take the lead in \\n\\nmobilizing climate finance. \\nThis item was taken up by the SBI in its opening plenary and \\nforwarded to informal consultations, which convened four times. \\nParties also met informally.\\n\\nIn the consultations, co-facilitated by Seyni Nafo (Mali) and \\n\\nOuti Honkatukia (Finland), discussions built on the presiding \\nofficers’ addendum and Co-Facilitators’ iterations.\\n\\nIn the first meeting, parties disagreed on language referring \\nto which parties should provide information. Many developing \\ncountries argued that Article 9.5 refers only to information \\nprovided by developed countries, while developed countries \\nargued that it encourages “other parties” to provide resources \\nand information. Parties strongly disagreed on options referring \\nto the adequacy, or review, or outcomes of the modalities, of the \\ninformation provided. Several parties stated that they do not have \\na mandate to discuss options other than their preferred option, and \\nsubsequently agreed to elevate the issue to the heads of delegation \\nlevel.\\n\\nDuring the next meeting, Co-Facilitator Honkatukia drew \\n\\nattention to the heads of delegation meeting and to discussions \\nunder APA agenda item 8 (possible additional matters) the same \\nday, which she said had indicated a mandate and willingness \\nto engage in “elements that have not been discussed in the past \\nin this room,” related to the process for communicating the \\ninformation under Article 9.5. Parties agreed to seek a balance \\nbetween discussing text on information to be provided and on \\nissues related to modalities, or a “process” for the provision of \\ninformation.\\n\\nOn draft decision text, parties’ views diverged, inter alia, on \\n\\nthe timing of the first biennial communications. On elements \\nof information, parties disagreed on text related to loss and \\ndamage, technology and capacity-building support, and a baseline \\nreference, among others. On issues related to the process, \\ndeveloped countries indicated preference for discussing the \\nelements “required for operationalizing Article 9.5 only,” such as \\navailability of information or timing of the first communications. \\nThey disagreed with developing countries’ suggestions to include \\ncommon time frames, a review or a role for the SCF, and linkages \\nbetween Articles 9.5 and 9.7 (ex post finance transparency).\\n\\nIn plenary, on 8 December, the SBI agreed to forward the most \\n\\nrecent iteration of the text to the COP. Those discussions are \\nsummarized under the APA on page 12.\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 17\\n\\nScope of and Modalities for the Periodic Assessment of the \\n\\nTechnology Mechanism in supporting the Paris Agreement: \\nDiscussions under this item are focused on elaborating the scope \\nof and modalities for the periodic assessment of the effectiveness \\nof the Technology Mechanism, established under paragraph 117 \\nof decision 1/CP.16 (Cancun Agreements), in supporting the \\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement on matters relating to \\ntechnology development and transfer. This item was first taken up \\nby the SBI in its opening plenary and subsequently addressed in \\ninformal consultations throughout the week co-facilitated by Ian \\nLloyd (US) and Claudia Octaviano (Mexico). \\n\\nDiscussions on a draft CMA decision text focused on assessing \\n\\nvarious kinds of support, including in-kind, and the adequacy \\nof the support provided to the Technology Mechanism. Several \\ndeveloped countries recognized the valuable in-kind support \\nprovided to the TEC, including by developing countries, \\nand cautioned against losing this recognition with language \\nspecifying only developed countries’ support. Some developing \\ncountries agreed on the value of developing countries’ support, \\nbut highlighted developed countries’ obligations under the \\nConvention. Developed countries called for focusing specifically \\non support to the Technology Mechanism, with some noting that \\nthe outcome of the Mechanism could not be expected to bring \\nabout transformational change. Developing countries suggested \\nfocusing on the financial needs of the Mechanism to enable \\ntechnology transfer and finding solutions for these.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations co-facilitated \\n\\nby Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Ian Lloyd (US).  Parties could not \\nagree on how to reflect the role of national designated entities \\n(NDEs) as recipients of the support. In addition, parties could \\nnot agree on how to specify the relationship between the periodic \\nassessment and the GST, and whether support to the Technology \\nMechanism should be provided by developed countries.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision, (FCCC/CP/2018/L.3), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  adopts the scope of and modalities for the periodic assessment \\n\\nof the effectiveness and adequacy of the support provided to \\nthe Technology Mechanism, as contained in the annex; \\n\\n•  decides that the periodic assessment should be undertaken in a \\n\\ntransparent, inclusive, and participatory manner; \\n\\n•  also decides to initiate the first periodic assessment at CMA 4 \\n(November 2021) in accordance with the scope and modalities \\nin the annex, or as these may be subsequently amended, with \\na view to completing the first periodic assessment at CMA 5 \\n(November 2022); and\\n\\n•  further decides that the outcomes of the periodic assessment \\n\\nshould serve as an input to the GST.\\nThe annex to the decision is divided into two parts: scope, \\n\\nwhich includes sections on effectiveness of the Technology \\nMechanism as well as on adequacy of the support provided to the \\nTechnology Mechanism; and a section on modalities.\\n\\nSubsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice \\n\\nSBSTA 49 convened from 2-8 December, when it adopted \\nits conclusions. On Saturday, 8 December, SBSTA Chair Paul \\nWatkinson (France) forwarded the proposed text to the COP, \\nwhere it was taken up in presidency consultations and at the \\nministerial level. Unless otherwise mentioned, on 15 December, \\nthe COP adopted decisions to be forwarded to the CMA as part of \\nthe Katowice Climate Package. \\n\\nArticle 6  (Cooperative Approaches), Article 6.2 \\n\\n(Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs)), \\nArticle 6.4 (mechanism under cooperative approaches), and \\nArticle 6.8 (non-market approaches): Discussions under this \\nitem aimed at operationalizing three types of market and non-\\nmarket mechanisms under the Paris Agreement: a cooperative \\nmechanism for transfers between countries of internationally \\ntransferred mitigation options (ITMOs); a mechanism for \\nallowing private sector parties to generate and sell emission \\nreduction units; and a non-market mechanism. This item with \\nall its sub-items was first taken up in the opening plenary. \\nNegotiations took place in a SBSTA contact group and subsequent \\ninformal consultations co-chaired by Kelley Kizzier (Ireland) and \\nMuslim Anshari Rahman (Singapore) that met throughout the \\nfirst week. On 8 December, the SBSTA forwarded draft text to \\nthe COP for further discussions, which took place in presidency \\nconsultations. \\n\\nIn the contact group, Costa Rica read out a joint submission by \\nColombia for AILAC, Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, \\nNew Zealand, and Switzerland on the need for corresponding \\nadjustments in connection with transfers of mitigation outcomes \\nand emission reductions under Article 6. The EU stressed the \\nneed to make tough decisions, including being specific on \\nenvironmental integrity. \\n\\nSaudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, suggested avoiding too much \\ntechnical complexity. Panama and Belize, with Senegal for the \\nAfrican Group, stressed the need to respect the diversity among \\nNDCs. Brazil opposed linking Article 6 to REDD+, while Panama \\nand Belize supported such a link. \\n\\nSt. Lucia, for AOSIS, emphasized prioritizing: operationalizing \\n\\nthe accounting structure; establishing environmental integrity \\nsafeguards; sustainable development provisions; and, with Egypt, \\nfor the Arab Group, allocating a share of proceeds to adaptation. \\nTuvalu, for the LDCs, called for an Agreement Article 6.2 \\n(ITMOs) oversight body to allow for up-front reporting.\\n\\nNegotiations continued in informals on the basis of three draft \\n\\ndecision texts presented by the Co-Chairs on each of the sub-\\nitems.\\n\\nOn Agreement Article 6.2 (ITMOs) and Agreement Article 6.4 \\n(mechanism under cooperative approaches), discussions focused \\non, inter alia: share of proceeds; overall mitigation; transfer; \\ncorresponding adjustments; and governance issues and safeguards \\nwith regards to ITMOs used outside the scope of NDCs.\\n\\nParties discussed an option that the share of proceeds from an \\nAgreement Article 6.4 activity would be levied and delivered to \\nthe Adaptation Fund to assist developing country parties that are \\nparticularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to \\nmeet the costs of adaptation. Some parties advocated the delivery \\nto the Adaptation Fund because the Fund does not have too many \\nprogramme restrictions and countries not engaging in the market \\nmechanism thereby can still benefit from it. These countries also \\nargued the share of proceeds to the Adaptation Fund should also \\napply to Agreement Article 6.2 activities. On this, views diverged. \\nThose opposing cautioned against renegotiating the Paris \\nAgreement. Views also diverged on an increased level of 5% of \\nshare of proceeds, and whether this should be voluntary.\\n\\nOn provisions for an overall mitigation requirement and \\nits application under Agreement Articles 6.2 and 6.4, parties \\ndiscussed a definition of achieving overall mitigation in global \\nemissions with many stressing the need to deliver an overall \\nreduction in global emissions. One party cautioned against \\nallowing market mechanisms to transfer responsibilities to \\ndeveloping countries. Another noted the need to discuss, in the \\ncontext of raising ambition, approaches utilized both “inside \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cand outside NDCs.” Many called for considering mandatory \\ncancellation and discounting options in this regard. Parties also \\ndiscussed baselines for the calculation of emission reductions to \\nbe applied in the design of activities for ITMOs and adjustments \\nin the context of ITMOs. \\n\\nOn the transition of mitigation outcomes under the Kyoto \\n\\nProtocol, such as the Clean Development Mechanism, to \\nAgreement Article 6.4 activities, several developing countries \\nsupported such a transition, stressing it would build credibility \\nand ensure demand for certified emission reductions. Many other \\nparties opposed, with one developed country group stressing that \\nparties should first establish a credible system before making \\ndecisions on transitioning. Another group expressed concern that \\nthe large supply of Kyoto Protocol units could undermine prices \\nand limit mitigation results. A number of parties said a transition \\nof current projects could be considered, if they met certain \\nconditions.\\n\\nOn how to avoid double counting and on the need for \\n\\nadjustments, views diverged, among other issues, on options for \\navoiding the use of emission reductions resulting from the Article \\n6.4 mechanism to achieve an NDC by more than one party. One \\ngroup underscored its view that there should be no requirement to \\nmake corresponding adjustments for the first international transfer \\nof Article 6.4 emissions reductions from the mechanism registry, \\nonly thereafter. Many opposed, underscoring the necessity of \\nupholding environmental integrity, and calling for a requirement \\nto make corresponding adjustments, as under Agreement \\nArticle 6.2 (ITMOs), for all emission reductions when those are \\ntransferred internationally.\\n\\nOn Agreement Article 6.8, parties discussed reporting under \\n\\nArticle 6.8 and its work programme activities and the governance \\nof the framework for non-market approaches (NMAs). Some \\npreferred to continue work without creating a new body, \\nsuggesting that a subsidiary body could to determine the need for \\ngovernance agreements after the completion of certain activities \\nunder the framework’s work programme. Others called for \\nestablishing a task force, held in conjunction with meetings of \\nthe subsidiary bodies, to maintain and operationalize the broader \\nnature of NMAs. One party stressed that the taskforce could \\naddress concerns and questions, including by addressing linkages \\nbetween mitigation and adaptation, and “matching them” to \\nmeans of implementation by building on existing processes and \\ninstitutional arrangements.\\n\\nThe COP convened presidency consultations on Article 6, \\n\\nco-facilitated by James Shaw, Minister for Climate Change, New \\nZealand, and Carolina Schmidt, Minister of the Environment, \\nChile. \\n\\nUnder Article 6.2 (ITMOs), on corresponding adjustments, \\n\\nparties could not agree to a proposed “menu approach” allowing \\ncountries to choose from a number of options including working \\non an emission, or emission reduction, basis, and ensuring clarity \\non conversion of metrics. Several parties supported the proposal, \\nwhile others opposed, calling for a single approach providing the \\nsame basis for all parties.\\n\\nOn purposes other than the achievement of NDCs, parties \\nexpressed: the need for a definition; concerns about double \\ncounting; and recognition that the UNFCCC does not have a \\nmandate to make rules for other international bodies. Parties had \\nopposing views on requiring up-front quantification for reporting \\npurposes.\\n\\nUnder Article 6.4 (mechanism under cooperative approaches), \\nparties discussed methodological principles of the activity cycle. \\nOne party called for high-level principles and a work programme \\nto develop them. Several parties expressed views on appropriate \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 18\\n\\nbaseline approaches, with some expressing reservations about \\napplications of business as usual and historic baselines. Some \\nnoted linkages to overall mitigation in global emissions. Parties \\nalso discussed the composition of the supervisory body.\\n\\nUnder Article 6.8 (framework for non-market approaches), \\nparties discussed a compromise in which the governance of the \\nframework would begin with the establishment of a forum with \\nassurances that a permanent governance arrangements will be \\nestablished in 2019. They also considered a compromise proposal \\non work programme activities.\\n\\nOn the way forward, Co-Facilitator Shaw explained that he \\n\\nwould inform the presidency that given the remaining differences, \\nonly bracketed text could be developed.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a procedural \\n\\ndecision to continue consideration. \\n\\nFinal Decision: Final Decision: In its decision (FCCC/\\n\\nCP/2018/L.28), the CMA, inter alia:\\n•  notes the consideration by the SBSTA and COP of the \\n\\nmandates contained in decision 1/CP.21, paragraphs 36-40 \\n(matters relating to Article 6);\\n\\n•  also notes that draft decision texts on these matters in the \\nproposal by the President were considered, but that parties \\ncould not reach consensus thereon; and,\\n\\n•  requests the SBSTA to continue consideration, taking into \\n\\nconsideration the draft decision texts considered at COP 24, \\nwith a view to forwarding a draft decision for consideration \\nand adoption by CMA 2.\\nModalities for Accounting of Financial Resources Provided \\n\\nand Mobilized in Accordance with Agreement Article 9.7 \\n(ex post finance transparency): This item was taken up by the \\nSBSTA in its opening plenary and forwarded to a contact group. \\nThe issue was discussed over five meetings, in either a contact \\ngroup or informal consultations. \\n\\nIn the contact group and informal consultations, co-chaired \\n\\nby Delphine Eyraud (France) and Seyni Nafo (Mali), discussions \\nfocused on the presiding officers’ addendum, textual proposals \\ndeveloped in informal consultations and text prepared by the \\nCo-Chairs. In the first meeting, parties disagreed about including \\nlanguage on “climate specific” and “new and additional” financial \\nresources, with a developing country group expressing discomfort \\nwith any “dilution” of these aspects. Several parties and groups \\nproposed focusing on elements that can be resolved at the \\ntechnical level, particularly underlying assumptions, definitions, \\nand methodologies. \\n\\nIn a subsequent meeting, parties discussed a proposal for \\n\\nunderlying assumptions, definitions, and methodologies. Many \\ncountries supported the changes in principle. Parties diverged \\non a new formulation related to “new and additional” support. \\nDiscussions continued in further meetings on the underlying \\nassumptions, definitions, and methodologies, with parties \\nrequesting text to be added, suggesting places where brackets \\ncould be removed, and expressing preferences for options. \\n\\nIn plenary, on 8 December, SBSTA agreed to forward the \\n\\nmost recent iteration of the text to the COP. The COP convened \\npresidency consultations on this issue in conjunction with other \\nissues related to finance. The text was included as a section in \\nthe MPGs for the transparency framework, which is summarized \\nunder the APA, see page 8.\\n\\nTechnology Framework: This item was first introduced in \\n\\nthe opening plenary and subsequently addressed in informal \\nconsultations, co-facilitated by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Mette \\nMoglestue (Norway). The SBI forwarded the text to the COP, \\nwhich convened further presidency consultations, co-facilitated \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 19\\n\\nby Carlos Fuller and Ian Lloyd. Parties worked on two draft CMA \\ndecisions on development and transfer of technologies.\\n\\nRegarding the technology framework, parties’ views diverged \\non enabling environments, including on incentivizing the private \\nand public sectors to fully realize technology development and \\ntransfer of climate technologies. Many stressed the importance of \\na reference to the public sector and that many NDEs are public \\ninstitutions. Others opposed, suggesting that the “public sector” \\nin this context is unclear. On collaboration and stakeholder \\nengagement, views diverged on the aim, including in a phrase \\nrelated to bridging knowledge and financial gaps.\\n\\nThe Co-Facilitator noted that bracketed text would be \\n\\nforwarded to the COP Presidency.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP and CMA adopted a decision.\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.7), the \\n\\nCMA, inter alia:\\n•  adopts the technology framework, as contained in the annex; \\n•  decides that the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) \\nand the CTCN, consistent with their respective functions, \\nmandates, and modalities of work, shall implement the \\ntechnology framework in close collaboration and under the \\nguidance of the CMA; \\n\\n•  requests the TEC and the CTCN to incorporate the guidance \\ncontained in the technology framework into their respective \\nworkplan and programme of work, which should also include \\nmethods for the monitoring and evaluation of their activities; \\n\\n•  requests the TEC and the CTCN to include information in \\ntheir joint annual report for 2019 on how they incorporated \\nthe guidance contained in the technology framework into their \\nrespective workplan and programme of work; \\n\\n•  requests the TEC and the CTCN to report on the progress of \\n\\ntheir work and challenges and lessons learned in implementing \\nthe technology framework in their joint annual reports; \\n\\n•  reiterates the importance of the support, including financial \\n\\nsupport, that shall be provided to developing country \\nparties for strengthening cooperative action on technology \\ndevelopment and transfer at different stages of the technology \\ncycle and agrees that the technology framework can facilitate \\nthe strengthening of such support; \\n\\n•  decides that the outcome of and/or recommendations resulting \\n\\nfrom the periodic assessment of the Technology Mechanism \\nshall be considered when updating the technology framework; \\nand\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to facilitate the implementation of the \\n\\ntechnology framework.\\nThe annex to the decision is divided into three parts: purpose, \\n\\nprinciples, and key themes for the technology framework. \\nThe key themes, which represent focused areas of action to \\nbe undertaken under the framework, include five sections on \\ninnovation, implementation, enabling environment and capacity-\\nbuilding, collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and support.\\n\\nItems Other than the Paris Agreement Work \\n\\nProgramme\\n\\nAt the Katowice Climate Change Conference, several issues \\n\\nrelating to the ongoing implementation of the Convention and the \\nKyoto Protocol were also on the agenda. These discussions and \\noutcomes are summarized below in the order of the agenda.\\n\\nConference of the Parties\\n\\nOrganizational Matters: Rules of procedure: Parties agreed \\nto apply the draft rules of procedure (FCCC/CP/1996/2), with the \\nexception of draft rule 42 on voting.\\n\\nAdoption of the agenda: On Sunday, 3 December, President \\nKurtyka introduced a supplementary provisional agenda (FCCC/\\nCP/2018/1/Add.1), containing a new agenda item proposal on \\nthe special needs and special circumstances of African countries \\nunder the Paris Agreement. He explained that, since the issuance \\nof this document, Honduras, for AILAC, Iran, for the Asia-Pacific \\nStates, and Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, had proposed new \\nagenda items, each on the special needs and special circumstances \\nof developing countries in their respective groups or regions. \\n\\nHe proposed, and the COP agreed, to adopt the supplementary \\n\\nprovisional agenda without a sub-item on a proposal to remove \\nTurkey from the list in Annex I to the Convention and without the \\nfour proposed items on the special needs and circumstances. He \\nsaid that consultations on these issues would convene under the \\npresidency’s authority. The COP adopted the agenda as proposed. \\nOn Friday, 14 December, Vice-President Ian Fry (Tuvalu) \\nreported that these consultations had not reached consensus.\\n\\nElection of officers other than the President: On 15 \\n\\nDecember, the COP elected members of the COP Bureau: Georg \\nBørsting (Norway); Ian Fry (Tuvalu); Mohamed Nasr (Egypt); \\nLois Young (Belize); and Majid Shafie-Pour (Iran).\\nThe COP also elected members to the Adaptation \\n\\nCommittee, Adaptation Fund Board, Advisory Board to the \\nCTCN, Consultative Group of Experts (CGE), Compliance \\nCommittee, both the facilitative and enforcement branches, \\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board, \\nWIM Executive Committee (ExCom), Joint Implementation \\nSupervisory Committee, Technology Executive Committee \\n(TEC), LDC Expert Group (LEG), and Local Communities and \\nIndigenous Peoples (LCIP) Platform Facilitative Working Group.\\nAdmission of observers: The COP admitted new observers, as \\n\\nproposed (FCCC/CP/2018/2).\\n\\nDates and venues of future sessions: The COP agreed that \\n\\nChile would host COP 25 (FCCC/CP/2018/L.6).\\n\\nCredentials: The COP adopted the report on credentials \\n\\n(FCCC/CP/2018/9).\\n\\nReports of the Subsidiary Bodies: On 8 December, the \\n\\nCOP adopted the reports of the subsidiary bodies. The COP also \\nadopted the decisions and conclusions contained in the report of \\nSBI 48 (FCCC/SBI/2018/9/Add.1) on:\\n•  the LDC work programme; \\n•  the review of the CTCN;\\n•  conclusions on the terms of reference for the review of the \\n\\nDoha work programme; and\\n\\n•  conclusions on coordination of support for the implementation \\nof activities in relation to mitigation actions in the forest sector \\nby developing countries, including institutional arrangements.\\nMandated Events: There were two events that were mandated \\nfor the COP to consider: the Talanoa Dialogue, mandated by COP \\n21 as the 2018 facilitative dialogue; and the pre-2020 stocktake. \\nBoth had technical and political phases during COP 24.

Discussions and the decision are summarized under \\nthe SBI on page 25.\\n\\nDevelopment and Transfer of Technologies and \\n\\nImplementation of the Technology Mechanism: Linkages \\nbetween the Technology Mechanism and the Financial \\nMechanism of the Convention: This item was first taken up \\nin plenary on 2 December 2018 and subsequently addressed \\nin informal consultations co-facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh \\n(Trinidad and Tobago) and Swan Senesi (Italy). The informal \\nconsultations met five times between 8-12 December, with party-\\nled informal informals meeting in between. \\n\\nThe negotiations focused on draft decision text, presented \\nby the Co-Facilitators, which many countries initially viewed \\nas “GCF-heavy.” They called for mentioning the collaboration \\nbetween the GEF and CTCN.\\n\\nCritical discussions focused on opposing views on whether to \\n\\nconclude this agenda item at COP 24, with one developed country \\ngroup arguing that the work is complete because the linkages are \\nestablished. A developing country opposed, arguing that the aims \\nof the work on linkages are not met and may not be until COP 26. \\n\\nParties discussed a compromise proposal by developed \\n\\ncountries to continue this item, after taking stock of progress in \\nstrengthening the linkages in 2020, under the reports of the GEF \\nand GCF, respectively. This was opposed by two developing \\ncountry groups, who cautioned that those agenda items focus on \\nreports from the respective bodies only and could not sufficiently \\naddress relevant linkages. \\n\\nParties also considered a proposal to continue substantive work \\nunder the SBI. Many developing countries stressed that only after \\na stocktake of progress could the continuation or conclusion of \\nthe item be considered. They proposed agreeing on considering \\nthe conclusion of this issue in the future, without prejudging \\nthe outcome of that consideration. Many developed countries \\nopposed, preferring to conclude consideration of this item. \\n\\nObserving no consensus, the group in informal consultations \\nconcluded with an understanding that Rule 16 would apply, with \\nmany lamenting that negotiation progress made on draft decision \\ntext would be lost. Co-Facilitator Kumarsingh informed he would \\nreport to the COP Presidency of the lack of agreement.\\n\\nOn Friday, 14 December the COP adopted its decision.\\nFinal Outcome: In its decision, (FCCC/CP/2018/L.4), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia, requests SBI 53 (November 2020), to take stock \\nof progress in strengthening the linkages between the Technology \\nMechanism and the Financial Mechanism with a view to \\nrecommending a draft decision on this matter, including on the \\nconsideration of a conclusion on this matter, for consideration and \\nadoption by COP 26 (November 2020). \\n\\nThe COP invites:\\n\\n•  the CTCN and the GCF to continue enhancing collaboration, \\n\\nwherein the services and expertise of the CTCN can be used to \\nstrengthen proposals seeking support under the readiness and \\npreparatory support programme of the Fund, noting the need \\nfor such engagement in supporting developing country parties \\nin building their capacity for undertaking technology projects \\nand programmes; \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 20\\n\\n•  developing country parties to seek support from the CTCN \\n\\nto develop and submit technology-related projects, including \\nthose resulting from technology needs assessments and from \\nthe technical assistance of the CTCN, to the operating entities \\nof the Financial Mechanism for implementation, in accordance \\nwith their respective policies and processes; and\\n\\n•  the CTCN to consult with the GCF and GEF to identify \\n\\nways to enhance information sharing among NDEs, national \\ndesignated authorities and GEF focal points.\\n\\nThe COP also welcomes:  \\n•  the support provided for technology development and transfer \\n\\nby the GEF and GCF through projects and programmes, \\nincluding for projects resulting from technology needs \\nassessments; and\\n\\n•  the collaboration between the TEC, CTCN and GCF on climate \\n\\ntechnology incubators and accelerators, noting that this will \\nhelp to inform the GCF as it develops the terms of reference \\nfor a request for proposals to support climate technology \\nincubators and accelerators.\\nSecond Review of the Adequacy of Articles 4(a) and (b) of \\n\\nthe Convention: This item was held in abeyance.\\n\\nMatters Relating to Finance: All these sub-items were first \\n\\ntaken up in the COP plenary on 2 December.\\n\\nLong-term finance: This item (FCCC/CP/2018/4) was first \\ntaken up in the COP Plenary on 2 December, and subsequently \\nin a contact group, co-chaired by Ivan Zambrana Flores (Bolivia) \\nand Norbert Gorißen (Germany). \\n\\nIn informal consultations, the Co-Chairs noted the submissions \\nreceived and encouraged further submissions during the session. \\nParties agreed to mandate the Co-Chairs to prepare draft text \\nbased on the submissions. \\n\\nThe EU said a lot has been achieved on the long-term finance \\nagenda and said the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) 2018 \\nBiennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows \\nconfirms that finance has been mobilized. Norway suggested that \\nthe decision, inter alia, take note of activities such as the 2018 \\nin-session workshop on long-term climate finance and biennial \\nhigh-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance. Parties also \\nproposed topics for the next in-session workshop, with Solomon \\nIslands, for AOSIS, proposing a session on the effects of 1.5°C of \\nglobal warming. Discussions continued in informal consultations \\non 7 December. On 11 December, the Secretariat published a draft \\ndecision that contained a bracketed reference to urging developed \\ncountries to scale up financial support for developing countries. \\nThe bracketed decision was discussed as part of the presidency \\nconsultations on finance.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP adopted the decision. \\nFinal Outcome: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.20), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia:\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the 2018 Biennial Assessment and \\n\\nOverview of Climate Finance Flows of the SCF, in particular \\nits key findings and recommendations highlighting the increase \\nin climate finance flows from developed to developing \\ncountries;\\n\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the continued progress of \\n\\ndeveloped countries towards reaching the goal of mobilizing \\njointly USD 100 billion annually by 2020;\\n\\n•  urges developed countries to continue to scale up mobilized \\n\\nclimate finance towards achieving the 2020 finance goal;\\n\\n•  urges developed countries to continue their efforts to channel a \\nsubstantial share of public climate funds to adaptation activities \\nand to strive to achieve a greater balance between finance for \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 21\\n\\nmitigation and for adaptation, recognizing the importance of \\nadaptation finance and the need for public and grant-based \\nresources for adaptation;\\n\\n•  welcomes the biennial submissions received to date from \\ndeveloped countries on their strategies and approaches for \\nscaling up climate finance from 2018 to 2020, and urges those \\ndeveloped countries that have not yet done so to submit this \\ninformation;\\n\\n•  welcomes the progress of parties’ efforts to strengthen their \\ndomestic enabling environments in order to attract climate \\nfinance, and requests parties to continue to enhance their \\nenabling environments and policy frameworks to facilitate the \\nmobilization and effective deployment of climate finance;\\n\\n•  decides that the in-session workshops on long-term climate \\nfinance in 2019 and 2020 will focus on the effectiveness of \\nclimate finance, including the results and impacts of finance \\nprovided and mobilized, and the provision of financial and \\ntechnical support to developing countries for their adaptation \\nand mitigation actions in relation to holding the increase in the \\nglobal average temperature to well below 2ºC and pursuing \\nefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5ºC;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to prepare a compilation and synthesis \\nof the biennial submissions of developed countries’ strategies \\nand approaches for scaling up climate finance from 2018 to \\n2020 in order to inform these in-session workshops;\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to organize these in-session workshops \\n\\nand to prepare summary reports on the workshops for \\nconsideration by COP 25 (November 2019) and COP 26 \\n(November 2020), respectively; and\\n\\n•  requests the Secretariat to continue to ensure that the \\n\\nworkshops are well-balanced by, inter alia, inviting both public \\nand private sector actors to attend them and summarizing \\nthe views expressed at the workshops in a fair and gender-\\nbalanced manner.\\nMatters relating to the Standing Committee on Finance: This \\n\\nitem (FCCC/CP/2018/15, Add.1, and INF.1) was first taken up \\non 2 December and subsequently in a contact group co-chaired \\nby Carlos Ivan Zambrana Flores (Bolivia) and Norbert Gorißen \\n(Germany).\\n\\nIn the contact group, views strongly diverged regarding \\nreferences to the key findings of the SCF’s 2018 Biennial \\nAssessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows technical \\nreport. South Africa, for the African Group, supported by India, \\ncautioned against “cherry picking” individual findings. Saudi \\nArabia, for the Arab Group, opposed referring to the findings. \\nThe EU underscored the relevance of highlighting the continuous \\nincrease in climate finance flows, with the US adding the \\nassessment’s findings were the result of a comprehensive exercise \\nand adopted by consensus by the SCF. Switzerland proposed to \\nnote the report with appreciation and move it to the annex. \\n\\nViews also diverged on: urging the SCF to continue the work \\non relevant information to make finance flows consistent with a \\npathway towards low-GHG and climate-resilient development; \\nalternating frequency between the fora of the SCF and the \\nBiennial Assessment, with a view to balance the SCF’s workload; \\nand requesting the SCF to undertake an assessment of developing \\ncountries’ financial needs. Informal consultations convened. \\nThe 10 December draft contained three bracketed requests \\n\\nto the SCF, each containing additional bracketed text. The \\nbrackets reflected disagreement over, inter alia: the relation \\nbetween the Convention and the Paris Agreement, references to \\nAgreement Article 9 (financial support), and whether the SCF \\nshould, in collaboration with others, explore ways and means to \\n“assess the needs of developing countries” or “assist developing \\n\\ncountries in assessing their needs and priorities, and in translating \\nclimate finance needs into action.” These were discussed in the \\npresidency consultations on finance.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the COP adopted the decision.\\nFinal Outcome: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.13), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia:\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the report of the SCF to COP 24, \\n\\ntaking note of the recommendations contained therein;\\n\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the 2018 Biennial Assessment and \\n\\nOverview of Climate Finance Flows of the SCF, in particular \\nthe summary and recommendations as contained in the annex \\nof the decision;\\n\\n•  encourages the SCF to take into account the best available \\n\\nscience in future Biennial Assessments; \\n\\n•  requests the SCF to use in the Biennial Assessments the \\n\\nestablished terminology in the provisions of the Convention \\nand the Agreement in relation to climate finance, where \\napplicable;\\n\\n•  requests the SCF to map, every four years, as part of its \\n\\nBiennial Assessments, the available information relevant to \\nmaking finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low-\\nGHG emissions and climate-resilient development;\\n\\n•  encourages the SCF to provide input to the technical paper \\n\\nof the WIM Executive Committee on the sources of financial \\nsupport;\\n\\n•  requests the SCF to prepare, every four years, a report on the \\n\\ndetermination of the needs of developing countries related \\nto implementing the Convention and the Agreement, for \\nconsideration by COP 26 and CMA 3 (November 2020); and\\n•  requests the SCF to report to COP 25 (November 2019) on \\n\\nprogress in implementing its workplan.\\nThe annex contains the summary and recommendations by the \\nSCF on the 2018 Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate \\nFinance Flows.\\n\\nReport of the GCF: Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Stefan \\n\\nSchwager (Switzerland) co-facilitated informal consultations. \\nOn 10 December, parties considered a new iteration of text \\nprepared during the day based on informal consultations in the \\nmorning. Discussions centered on a paragraph requesting the SCF \\nto prepare assessments of funds necessary to assist developing \\ncountries in implementing the Convention with a view to help \\ninform the first GCF replenishment process. \\n\\nMany developed countries opposed discussing an alternative \\n\\ntext proposal by a developing country group. One country \\nopposed reference to the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, stating \\nthat this would skew funding towards mitigation. This was \\nopposed by another country, who saw this as “also an investment \\nin adaptation.” Parties also bracketed paragraphs related to, inter \\nalia, addressing remaining policy gaps and urging parties to fully \\nexecute their contribution arrangements or agreements under \\nthe initial GCF resource mobilization. In a brief contact group \\nmeeting, Co-Chair Schwager said the text would be presented to \\nthe COP presidency. \\n\\nFurther presidency consultations on finance discussed this \\n\\nissue. On 15 December, the COP adopted the decision.\\n\\nFinal Outcome: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.12), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia: \\n•  urges the Board to continue consideration of procedures for \\n\\nadopting decisions in the event that all efforts at reaching \\nconsensus have been exhausted, as specified in the Fund’s \\nGoverning Instrument;\\n\\n•  stresses the urgency to reach pledges for the first formal \\nreplenishment process aiming to conclude the process in \\nOctober 2019;\\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0c•  invites parties to submit to the Secretariat, no later than two \\n\\nweeks prior to COP 25 (November 2019), their views and \\nrecommendations on elements to be taken into account in \\ndeveloping guidance for the Board; \\n\\n•  requests the SCF to take into consideration the submissions \\nreferred to above when preparing its draft guidance for the \\nBoard for consideration by the COP; and\\n\\n•  requests the Board to include in its annual report to the COP \\n\\ninformation on the steps that it has taken to implement the \\nguidance provided in this decision.\\nReport of the GEF: Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and Stefan \\n\\nSchwager (Switzerland) co-facilitated informal consultations \\non this item (FCCC/CP/2018/6, Add.1, and INF.1). Exchanging \\nviews on draft text, parties disagreed on whether to recognize, \\nwelcome, or note the 7th replenishment of the GEF, as well as \\nwhether to include percentages or figures to specify decreases \\nin GEF funding between the 6th and 7th replenishment. One \\ndeveloping country proposed replacing quantitative information \\nwith the term “significant decrease.” Parties strongly disagreed \\non language that instructs the GEF to consider improving access \\nmodalities for developing country institutions. A developed \\ncountry group argued that because the GEF differs fundamentally \\nfrom other funds, enabling direct access modalities would “open \\nthe floodgates” for national institutions’ accreditation across \\ndifferent environmental conventions. A developing country \\nopposed, calling for a “paradigm shift” to promote direct access \\nfor developing country institutions.\\n\\nParties also strongly disagreed on two paragraphs addressing \\n\\npolitical and non-technical barriers to accessing GEF funding, \\nwith one developed country describing the language as a \\n“red line.” The draft text was forwarded to the presidency for \\nconsideration at the ministerial level. \\n\\nThis issue was also further discussed in presidency \\n\\nconsultations. On 15 December, the COP adopted its decision.\\nFinal Outcome: In its decision (FCCC/CP/2018/L.10), the \\n\\nCOP, inter alia: \\n•  highlights the importance of enhancing country ownership in \\n\\nthe impact programmes of the 7th GEF replenishment; \\n\\n•  urges all parties that have not made pledges for the 7th GEF \\n\\nreplenishment to do so as soon as possible; \\n\\n•  invites the GEF to enhance the information in its reports to \\nthe COP on the outcomes of the collaboration between the \\nPoznan strategic programme on technology transfer’s climate \\ntechnology and finance centers and the CTCN; \\n\\n•  welcomes the GEF Council’s decision to begin the process \\nof developing improved fiduciary standards, including anti-\\nmoney-laundering and counter-terrorism finance policy; \\n•  requests the GEF to review and, if necessary, update, or \\n\\nadopt policies for the prevention of sexual harassment and \\nabuse of authority with the aim of protecting the staff of the \\nGEF Secretariat as well as its partner organizations against \\nunwanted sexual advances, preventing inappropriate behavior, \\nand abuse of power and providing guidelines for reporting \\nincidents;\\n\\n•  invites parties to submit to the Secretariat in writing, no \\n\\nlater than ten weeks prior to COP 25, their views and \\nrecommendations on elements to be taken into account in \\ndeveloping guidance for the GEF; \\n\\n•  requests the SCF to take into consideration the submissions \\nreferred to above when preparing its draft guidance for the \\nGEF by the COP; and \\n\\n•  requests the GEF to include in its annual report to the COP \\ninformation on the steps that it has taken to implement the \\nguidance provided in this decision. \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 22\\n\\nReporting from and Review of Annex I Parties: This item \\n\\nwas referred to the SBI (see page 24).\\n\\nReporting from Non-Annex I Parties: This item was referred \\n\\nto the SBI (see page 24).\\n\\nCapacity Building Under the Convention: This item was \\n\\nreferred to the SBI (see page 26).\\n\\nImplementation of Articles 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention: \\n\\nImplementation of the Buenos Aires programme of work on \\nadaptation and response measures: This item was referred to the \\nSBI and SBSTA (see page 27).\\n\\nMatters relating to the least developed countries: This item \\nwas discussed at SBI 48 and the decision was forwarded to the \\nCOP.\\n\\nFinal Decision: In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2018/9/Add.1), the \\nCOP decides to update the elements of the LDC work programme \\nas listed below in order to reflect the needs of LDCs, taking full \\naccount of the numerous groups and bodies that are involved in \\nassisting countries with these activities, noting the importance of \\navoiding duplication of work, and taking into account available \\nresources: \\n•  continue strengthening existing, and where needed \\n\\nestablishing, national climate change secretariats and/or \\nfocal points to enable the effective implementation of the \\nConvention, the Protocol and the Agreement in LDCs; \\n\\n•  continue providing training, as needed, in negotiating skills and \\n\\nlanguage to develop the capacity of negotiators from LDCs to \\nparticipate effectively in the climate change process; \\n\\n•  supporting the preparation and implementation of successive \\n\\nNDCs as well as the process to formulate and implement NAPs \\nand related relevant adaptation strategies, including national \\nadaptation programmes of action; \\n\\n•  continue promoting public awareness programmes to ensure \\nthe dissemination of information on climate change issues; \\n\\n•  continue strengthening cooperative action on adaptation \\n\\ntechnology development and transfer; \\n\\n•  continue strengthening the capacity of meteorological and \\n\\nhydrological services to collect, analyze, model, interpret and \\ndisseminate weather and climate information to support the \\nimplementation of adaptation actions; and \\n\\n•  continue supporting capacity-building initiatives to enable \\n\\neffective engagement in reporting and review activities under \\nthe Convention and the Agreement, as needed. \\n\\nThe COP also, inter alia:\\n•  requests the LEG to support, and encourages other relevant \\n\\nbodies and programmes under and outside the Convention and \\nthe Paris Agreement, including UN entities, to assist with, in \\naccordance with their respective mandates, as appropriate, the \\nimplementation of the LDC work programme and to include \\ninformation on this in their reports, as appropriate; and\\n\\n•  also requests the LEG to continue considering ways to promote \\n\\nSouth-South cooperation in the implementation of the LDCs \\nwork programme.\\nAdministrative, Financial and Institutional Matters: On 2 \\nDecember, the COP referred this item, and its sub-items, to the \\nSBI.

AOSIS suggested that the \\nFund’s experience, with projects focused on the most vulnerable, \\ncould serve the Paris Agreement by filling the data gaps \\nhighlighted in the SCF 2018 Biennial Assessment. The LDCs \\nexpressed a wish for further improvements in the accreditation \\nprocess, and project review and approval cycle. The G-77/\\nChina expressed alarm at the low levels of financing to the Fund \\naccrued through the sale of certified emission reductions (CERs). \\nThe LDCs called for “a number of countries” to make further \\ncontributions to the Fund. Parties mandated the Co-Chairs to \\nprepare draft decision text, based on the interventions. \\n\\nExchanging views on the draft decision text, Maldives, \\n\\nfor AOSIS, proposed adding a placeholder to outcomes from \\nAdaptation Fund consultations underway “under the APA.” \\nMuyungi said the Co-Chairs did not have a mandate to cross-\\nreference text to a stand-alone agenda item. The EU, South \\nAfrica for the African Group, and Pakistan supported the AOSIS \\nproposal. The draft text with the placeholder was forwarded for \\nconsideration by the CMP.\\n\\nOn 15 December, the CMP adopted the decision.\\nFinal Decision: In the final decision (FCCC/KP/\\n\\nCMP/2018/L.6) the CMP, inter alia:\\n•  takes note of the annual report of the Adaptation Fund Board, \\nincluding its addendum, and the information contained therein;\\n•  notes, inter alia, the accreditation of 28 national implementing \\n\\nentities for accessing resources from the Adaptation Fund \\ndirectly, cumulative project and programme approvals reaching \\nUSD 476.8 million, funds available for new funding approvals \\namounting to USD 225.7 million, and the value of projects and \\nprogrammes in the active pipeline estimated at over USD 270 \\nmillion;\\n\\n•  notes the total amount of USD 95.9 million in contributions \\nmade to the Adaptation Fund in 2017, which surpassed the \\nUSD 80 million fundraising target;\\n\\n•  reiterates its concern regarding the issues related to the \\n\\nsustainability, adequacy, and predictability of funding for the \\nAdaptation Fund due to the current uncertainty about the prices \\nof CERs;\\n\\n•  welcomes with appreciation the AFB’s consideration of and \\n\\nreport on linkages to other funds to ensure coherence and \\ncomplementarity; and\\n\\n•  encourages the AFB to continue its efforts to enhance \\n\\ncomplementarity and coherence with other funds both under \\nand outside the Convention, including to better align processes \\nand leverage financing.\\nReport of the High-Level Ministerial Roundtable on \\n\\nIncreased Ambition of Kyoto Protocol Commitments: This \\nitem was first taken up by the CMP plenary on 2 December \\nand subsequently in informal consultations facilitated by Adam \\nGuibourgé-Czetwertyński (Poland).

Despite \\n\\nthe clear warnings of science and the steady drumbeat of extreme \\nweather events worldwide, global emissions increased in 2017. \\nThe political context has shifted, with a marked turn away from \\nmultilateralism to populism and, in some cases, opposition to \\nscientific evidence. The transition to a zero-emissions economy \\nis not yet fully underway, a fact made clear by the location of \\nthe Katowice Climate Conference in the heart of Poland’s coal-\\nproducing region. \\n\\nDespite these political headwinds, the long-standing \\n\\ndisagreements among countries, and the technical complexity of \\nthe task, COP 24 delivered. The “Katowice Climate Package” \\n\\nadopted late on Saturday, 15 December, puts in place a set \\nof implementation guidelines that were considered by many \\nto be sufficiently robust. But does it establish the strong and \\nstable institutional framework needed to implement the Paris \\nAgreement? And, given the signals of increasing urgency, what \\ndoes this framework mean for ambition in the post-2020 era? \\nThis brief analysis will examine the rulebook in more detail \\nby focusing on key parameters of success, namely: resolution \\nof contentious political issues; delivering effective guidelines \\nfor a dynamic architecture; and building the basis for increased \\nambition. \\n\\nThe Road to the Rulebook\\n\\nCOP 24 had one clear goal: to deliver the “rulebook.” After \\n\\nthree years of difficult negotiations, parties had two final weeks to \\nturn the Paris Agreement’s broad commitments into the detailed \\ntechnical guidance needed to measure mitigation, account for \\nfinance, and ensure transparency. Since establishing this deadline \\nat COP 22 in Marrakesh, countries had barely budged from their \\nnegotiating positions. And despite an extra negotiating session in \\nBangkok in September 2018, delegates arrived in Katowice with \\nfundamental differences yet to be resolved in a 236-page text. \\n\\nThese differences were both long-standing––rooted in \\n\\nhistorical debates about responsibility and leadership––and \\nspecific to differing interpretations of the Paris Agreement itself. \\nThe primary sticking point was differentiation. Developing \\ncountries have long argued that they should be granted flexibility \\nin their mitigation efforts, while developed countries have sought \\ncommon rules that will hold all, especially emerging economies, \\nequally accountable. The Paris Agreement provided little clarity \\non this issue. While it broke the binary division between Annex \\nI and non-Annex I parties, it replaced this with language that \\nis either ambiguous or varies across different provisions. For \\nexample, in financing provisions, the Paris Agreement introduced \\nthe concept of “other parties” that are encouraged to provide \\nvoluntary support. Establishing a “robust” rulebook therefore \\nrequired resolving these ambiguities in a way that balances \\ndeveloping countries’ differing capacities with clear and common \\nguidance that ensures higher ambition. \\n\\nAdditionally, parties had to overcome simmering distrust \\n\\nabout the sufficiency and predictability of financial support to \\ndeveloping countries, which they regard as crucial to enhance \\ntheir ambition. In the past year, this distrust had crystallized in \\ndebates over “Article 9.5” (indicative information on provision \\nof finance) and the process to establish a new long-term \\nfinance goal. As negotiations proceeded slowly during the first \\nweek, and chaotically behind closed doors during the second, \\nsome expressed fear that the divides over differentiation and \\nfinance would simply be too broad to bridge, and that another \\nCopenhagen catastrophe could be in the making. \\n\\nParties delivered despite these fears. But how strong is the \\n\\nKatowice Climate Package? The rulebook could be expected to \\ndeliver stronger ambition in at least four ways. First, by resolving \\npolitically difficult issues left lingering from Paris. Second, by \\nbalancing the need for binding and prescriptive guidance with \\nthe need for flexibility, to maximize both effectiveness and \\nparticipation by all countries. Third, by enabling a dynamic \\nagreement through strong collective and individual review \\nmechanisms and timelines for revisiting its guidelines. Fourth, by \\naddressing all relevant issues now, as opposed to leaving them for \\nfuture negotiations. \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cA Balanced Rulebook\\n\\nResolving long-standing issues was a prerequisite for a \\n\\nsuccessful outcome, as parties would only agree to what they \\nperceived to be a balanced package. The ministerial negotiations \\nduring the second week were crucial for unlocking the agreement \\non the two most contentious issues: differentiation and finance. \\nIn the final agreement, more uniform and mitigation-centric \\nNDC guidance, which developed countries see as central to the \\nAgreement, is balanced with improved processes for financial \\nsupport for developing countries. \\n\\nIn guidance for communicating and accounting for mitigation \\ntargets, the majority view of creating a common set of elements \\nthat each country would apply based on the type of its NDC―\\nan absolute emission reduction target or a relative emission \\nintensity target, for example―prevailed over long-standing \\ncalls for a binary set of rules, one for developed and another \\nfor developing countries, which had been supported by the \\nLike-minded Developing Countries and Arab Group. These \\ngroups also called for a “full scope” approach to guidance on \\nNDCs, by which countries would communicate their mitigation \\nintentions together with their plans on adaptation and means of \\nimplementation. The agreed guidance focuses on mitigation but, \\nin an acknowledgement to these countries, allows for inclusion in \\nNDCs of information on adaptation and on mitigation co-benefits \\nresulting from adaptation actions or economic diversification \\nplans. \\n\\nDeveloping countries’ calls for a clear process to assess and \\nreview developed countries’ indicative finance provision reports \\nwere heeded. The agreed guidance in this area (Paris Agreement \\nArticle 9.5) now provides for synthesis reports, workshops, \\nand ministerial meetings that will focus on evaluating finance \\ninformation and, undoubtedly, its sufficiency. \\n\\nDeveloping countries also welcomed an agreement to initiate, \\n\\nin 2020, deliberations on setting the new collective quantified \\nfinance goal for the post-2025 period. Under the Paris Outcome, \\ncountries agreed to set this goal, but developed countries had \\nso far demonstrated unwillingness to even set a date for starting \\ndiscussions. While the rationale for this position was not openly \\nspelled out, many attributed this initial reluctance to discuss the \\nnew finance goal to the US walking away from the Agreement as \\nwell as political and economic challenges in many industrialized \\ncountries. \\n\\nAlso significant for developing countries was the final decision \\n\\non the Adaptation Fund, as many of these countries consider \\nadaptation finance a top priority. The Adaptation Fund, which \\ncurrently serves the Kyoto Protocol and receives shares of \\nproceeds from its offsetting mechanisms, will now exclusively \\nserve the Paris Agreement once the share of proceeds from \\nthe Paris Agreement offsetting mechanism becomes available. \\nThe Fund will also be financed by voluntary public and private \\nsources.\\n\\nAn Effective Rulebook\\n\\nReaching compromise on the politically-challenging issues of \\ndifferentiation and finance enabled parties to focus on developing \\nguidance that would be binding and detailed enough while \\nmaximizing participation. Many did not expect countries to \\nreach an outcome that contains both legally-binding language, \\nsuch as “shall” or “should,” and prescriptive guidance that \\nensures information communicated by countries is clear and \\ncomparable. However, the overall sense was that the 97 pages of \\noperational guidelines delivered by parties in Katowice represent \\na commendable outcome in both regards. \\n\\nVol. 12 No. 747  Page 32\\n\\nThe transparency framework, which, together with the global \\n\\nstocktake, is often considered to be the core component of the \\nParis Agreement’s “ambition mechanism,” delivers on all these \\nparameters: the detailed guidance on countries’ reporting and \\nreview obligations establishes that all parties “shall” submit \\ntransparency reports every two years. The transparency guidelines \\ninclude elements that are common for all parties, including \\ncommon reporting tables and a requirement to submit the first \\nreport by 2024, but they also allow for flexibility for developing \\ncountries in the scope, frequency, and level of detail of reporting. \\nHowever, developing countries are also required to explain why \\nthey need the flexibility and provide self-determined time frames \\nto improve reporting. In many areas of the rulebook, including \\ntransparency, the guidelines also give the most vulnerable \\ncountries, namely LDCs and SIDS, added flexibility in terms of \\nhow and when they apply the guidance. \\n\\nIt was also crucial that the guidance emerging from Katowice \\n\\nenable the Paris Agreement to become the dynamic ambition \\nmechanism it was intended to be, with comprehensive rules for \\nfive-year cycles for submitting national plans, or NDCs, and \\nreviewing their implementation, on the one hand, and a robust \\nsystem for taking stock of collective progress, on the other. The \\nglobal stocktake, which is the central mechanism for this latter \\npurpose, was duly operationalized, but left some discouraged. \\nMany observers from the environmental NGO and research \\ncommunity, as well as a large number of developing countries, \\nfelt that there is insufficient guidance on how to consider equity in \\nthe inputs and outputs of the stocktake. Observers also lamented \\nwhat they felt was a near-exclusion of non-party stakeholders \\nfrom the process, with their role reduced to making submissions \\nand not, for example, participating in the consideration of outputs \\nfrom the stocktake. Some fear that without accounting for equity \\nor engaging non-party stakeholders, the global stocktake could be \\nless effective in holding countries accountable and in presenting a \\nsufficiently comprehensive overview of global efforts.\\n\\nThe guidelines from Katowice also give some teeth to the \\n\\nimplementation and compliance committee, which, as set in Paris, \\nhas a facilitative role only, but is now empowered to initiate, \\nof its own accord, consideration of non-compliance in certain \\ncases. These include when a country has not communicated or \\nmaintained a NDC, submitted its transparency report, or, in the \\ncase of a developed country, its indicative finance report.\\nA further dimension of the rulebook’s contribution to \\n\\ndynamism is how it mandates adjustments to the rules over time. \\nMany sections of the Katowice package set timeframes for review \\nand possible revision of the guidance. One such example is the \\nguidance on information and accounting related to mitigation, \\nwhich is mandated to happen in 2028, even if some groups, such \\nas AOSIS, felt that this will come too late. \\n\\nFinally, one of the most important accomplishments of the \\nKatowice outcome is that parties were able to agree to most \\nelements of the Paris Agreement Work Programme. Failing to \\nagree would have weakened external perceptions of countries’ \\ndetermination to implement the Agreement and damaged the \\ncredibility of the UNFCCC process. The only major exception \\nwas cooperative approaches under Article 6 relating to guidance \\nfor international transfers of mitigation outcomes, rules for \\nthe Agreement’s carbon offsetting mechanism, and a work \\nprogramme for non-market-based approaches. Decisions on all \\nthese items were postponed to the next CMA session in 2019 due \\nto what many described as one country’s opposition to strict rules \\non double counting of emission reductions. This refusal caused \\nnegotiations to stretch late into Saturday as countries sought to \\nsave the work accomplished during this session and to agree to \\n\\nEarth Negotiations BulletinTuesday, 18 December 2018\\x0cVol. 12 No. 747  Page 33\\n\\nkey rules and institutional arrangements, which they felt were \\nimportant to provide a signal of continuity to markets and the \\nprivate sector.\\n\\nParties’ inability to resolve the future role of markets in the \\ninstitutional architecture of the Paris Agreement at COP 24 did \\nnot necessarily weaken the outcome, but will need to be quickly \\nresolved. \\n\\nA Rulebook that Enables Ambition\\n\\nThe “1,000 little steps countries took together” to reach \\n\\nagreement on the rulebook adopted in Katowice will undoubtedly \\nhelp “move us one step further to realizing the ambition enshrined \\nin the Paris Agreement,” as noted by COP 24 President Michał \\nKurtyka upon gaveling the package through. The rulebook itself \\nsends an important political message that the Paris Agreement is \\nalive and well. But what does it mean for more ambitious climate \\naction going forward?\\n\\nMany who came to Poland expected further political signals \\non ambition, in the form of a strong outcome, or perhaps even \\na continuation of the Talanoa Dialogue, broadly considered as \\na “pre-global stocktake” of sorts, initiated by the Fijian COP \\n23 Presidency and based on a Pacific storytelling tradition. \\nThere were also calls for decision text encouraging countries to \\nenhance their NDCs by 2020. Instead, the “Katowice Climate \\nPackage,” decision, which contains the Paris rulebook and also \\nother sections with more political messages, merely “takes note” \\nof the Dialogue and invites parties to consider its outcome in \\npreparing their NDCs. Some also noted that there were fewer \\nannouncements of new climate finance than at previous COPs, \\nwhich they felt indicated reduced commitment by developed \\ncountries to support ambition of developing countries.\\n\\nNon-party stakeholders are considered crucial to help raise \\n\\nambition both by increasing the transparency of the negotiation \\nprocess and as important contributors to climate action. Many \\nobservers lamented the fact that the entire second week of \\nnegotiations unfolded behind closed doors with few reports back \\nfrom the ministerial consultations. Some also noted a diminished \\nfocus on the Global Climate Action Agenda, kickstarted in 2014 \\nto orchestrate broad coalitions of the willing and incorporate \\nthese actors into the formerly exclusively intergovernmental \\nregime. While diminished transparency may have been necessary \\nto allow for resolution of the most politically-difficult issues at \\nthis COP, some expressed doubts about the UNFCCC’s ability to \\ninstitutionalize the participation of a broader set of actors in the \\nlonger term.\\n\\nVulnerable countries, in particular, also hoped for political \\nsignals on determination to keep global warming below 1.5°C, \\nconsidered a question of survival by many small island states. In \\nthis regard, resistance by four countries—Saudi Arabia, the US, \\nRussia, and Kuwait—to “welcome” the IPCC Special Report on \\n1.5°C during the first week created a media tsunami, which may \\nhave compensated for the lack of strong language on the report \\nin the final package decision. The least developed countries and \\nsmall island developing states were also disappointed with what \\nthey described as continued sidelining of the issue of loss and \\ndamage and stressed the urgency to provide real financial support. \\n\\nThe Katowice COP delivered on its mandate and now parties \\n\\nmust turn the page to a new era of implementation and higher \\nambition. As noted by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, \\nin a speech read at the closing of the conference by UNFCCC \\nExecutive Secretary Patricia Espinosa: the priorities now are \\n“ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition, and ambition,” on \\nmitigation, adaptation, finance, technological cooperation, \\ncapacity building, and innovation.
