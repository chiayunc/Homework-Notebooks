Relevant provisions of the ConventionThe Convention refers to adaptation in several articles.First ofall,the ultimateobjective ofthe Convention is to stabilize “greenhouse gas concentrations inthe atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenicinterference with the climate system.Such a level should be achieved within atime frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change,to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economicdevelopment to proceed in a sustainable manner”(Article 2).In their commitments under Article 4.1(b) ofthe Convention,all Parties are to“formulate,implement,publish and regularly update national and,whereappropriate,regional programmes containing measures to … facilitateadequate adaptation to climate change”.In the same way as for all theprovisions ofArticle 4.1,this is subject to “common but differentiatedresponsibilities and specific national and regional development priorities,objectives and circumstances”ofall Parties.Article 4.1(e) calls on Parties to “cooperate in preparing for adaptation to theimpacts ofclimate change;develop and elaborate appropriate and integratedplans for coastal zone management,water resources and agriculture,and forthe protection and rehabilitation ofareas,particularly in Africa,affected bydrought and desertification,as well as floods”.Article 4.1(f) requires Parties to “take climate change considerations into account,to the extent feasible,in their relevant social,economic and environmental policiesand actions”.It also calls on Parties to “employ appropriate methods,for exampleimpact assessments,formulated and determined nationally”,with a view tominimizing adverse effects that adaptation projects or measures could have on theeconomy,on public health or on the quality ofthe environment.Article 4.4 requires Annex II Parties to “assist the developing country Partiesthat are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects ofclimate change inmeeting costs ofadaptation to those adverse effects”.Article 4.8 ofthe Convention calls on Parties to give full consideration,inimplementing their commitments,to “what actions are necessary under theConvention,including actions related to funding,insurance and the transfer oftechnology,to meet the specific needs and concerns ofdeveloping country92UNFCCC Handbook12Chapter',\n",
       " 'Adapting to climate change9312Parties arising from the adverse effects ofclimate change and/or the impact ofthe implementation ofresponse measures”.It also lists categories ofcountriesthat may be particularly affected66.Article 4.9 further requires Parties “to take full account ofthe specific needsand special situations ofthe least developed countries in their actions withregard to funding and transfer oftechnology”.12.B. Work related to adaptation under the ConventionAdaptation received less attention than mitigation in the early years,as Partiesrequested more certainty on impacts of,and vulnerability to,climate changebefore agreeing on concrete adaptation measures.With the publication oftheIPCC Third Assessment Report,(see Box 12.1 for findings and definitions)adaptation gained more momentum and Parties agreed at COP 7 on a processto address the adverse effects ofclimate change and on establishing three newspecial funds (see chapter 13).The importance ofadaptation was reaffirmed in the Delhi Ministerial Declarationon Climate Change and Sustainable Development(decision 1/CP.8).TheDeclaration notes,for example,that “adaptation to the adverse effects ofclimate change is ofhigh priority for all countries.Developing countries areparticularly vulnerable,especially the least developed countries (LDCs) andSmall Island Developing States (SIDS).Adaptation requires urgent attentionand action on the part ofall countries.Effective and result-based measuresshould be supported for the development ofapproaches at all levels onvulnerability and adaptation,as well as capacity-building for the integration ofadaptation concerns into sustainable development strategies”.Issues related to adaptation have been included in a number ofareas ofworkunder the Convention.In addition to the items on the SBI and SBSTA agendas thatspecifically address vulnerability and adaptation,other areas include providingfinancial resources (see chapter 13),transferring technology (see chapter 14),improving research and systematic observation (see chapter 15),increasingeducation,training and public awareness (see chapter 16),building capacity (seechapter 17) and preparing national communications (see chapter 18).Activities relating to adaptation focus on:1.collecting,compiling,synthesizing and disseminating information oneffects,vulnerability and adaptation,including information onmethodologies,technologies and activities reported in nationalcommunications and national adaptation programmes ofaction (NAPAs);66Small island countries;countries with low-lying coastal areas;countries with arid and semi-arid areas,forestedareas and areas liable to forest decay;countries with areas prone to natural disasters;countries with areasliable to drought and desertification;countries with areas ofhigh urban atmospheric pollution;countries withareas with fragile ecosystems,including mountainous ecosystems;countries whose economies are highlydependent on income generated from the production,processing and export,and/or on the consumption offossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products;and land-locked and transit countries.',\n",

Those particularlyat risk include glaciers, coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpineecosystems, prairie wetlands, and remnant native grasslands.Human systems too are sensitive to climate change, and those vulnerable include: water resources;agriculture and food security; forestry; coastal zones and fisheries; settlements; energy and industry;insurance and other financial services; and health.Adaptationis defined by the IPCC as the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual orexpected climatic stimuli or their effects that moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Varioustypes of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and publicadaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.Adaptation policyis defined by the IPCC as action taken by governments including legislation, regulationsand incentives to mandate or facilitate changes in socio-economic systems aimed at reducing vulnerabilityto climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Changes can be made in practices, processes,or structures of systems in response to projected or actual changes in climate.',\n",

Addressing vulnerability to the adverse effects of climatechange (Article 4.8)How to address the particular vulnerability ofdeveloping countries firstappeared as a separate agenda item at COP 3 in 1997.After consideration,Parties,by decision 3/CP.3,asked the SBI to launch a process to identify actionsnecessary to meet the needs ofdeveloping countries specified in Article 4.8and 4.9.At COP 4 (November 1998),Parties adopted a work programme onthis issue (decision 5/CP.4 and Annex) as part ofthe Buenos Aires Plan ofAction.In decision 5/CP.4,the COP noted that gaps in information on theadverse effects ofclimate change and their assessment should be filled.Thespecific needs and concerns ofdeveloping countries should be identified,forinstance,on the basis oftheir national communications.The process ofimplementing Article 4.8 and 4.9 was further outlined at COP 5 (decision12/CP.5) and involved,inter alia,a number ofworkshops on this issue68.At COP 7,the process initiated at COP 3 resulted in an agreement as part oftheMarrakesh Accords.It included a decision on implementing Article 4.8 and4.9 (decision 5/CP.7) as well as the establishment ofthree new funds:theSpecial Climate Change Fund (SCCF),the Least Developed Countries Fund(LDCF) and the Adaptation Fund (see chapter 13).To address the adverse effects ofclimate change,decision 5/CP.7 provided alist ofactivities in the areas ofinformation and methodologies as well asvulnerability and adaptation,to be funded by the GEF Trust Fund,the SCCFand the Adaptation Fund as well as other sources,which includes:collecting data,undertaking research into effects and monitoring them;assessing vulnerability and options for adapting to climate change;building capacity for,for instance,disaster preparedness and managementand integrating adaptation measures into sustainable development;transferring technologies for adaptation to climate change;improving early warning systems for rapid response to extreme weatherevents;implementing adaptation activities where appropriate.In addition,decision 5/CP.7 sets out a longer-term programme ofanalyticalwork on the adverse effects ofclimate change and the impact oftheimplementation ofresponse measures (see section 12.B.3.),involving a seriesofworkshops.Workshops were held in 2002 and 2003 on:modelling activities to assess the adverse effects ofclimate change andthe impact ofresponse measures69;insurance issues around climate change,extreme weather events and theimpact ofresponse measures70;68See FCCC/SB/1999/9 for results ofthe workshops <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/1999/sb/09.pdf>and FCCC/SB/2000/2 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2000/sb/02.pdf>.69FCCC/SBI/2002/9 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2002/sbi/09.pdf>.70FCCC/SBI/2003/11 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sbi/11.pdf>.',\n",

Otherguiding elements include:sustainable development;gender equality;sound environmental management; andcost-effectiveness.NAPAs should be prepared in a participatory process, involving, in particular, localcommunities. To this end, the guidelines suggest setting up a national NAPA teamcomposed of a lead agency and representatives of stakeholders, includinggovernment agencies and civil society. The national NAPA team will assemble abroader, multidisciplinary team to work on most of the tasks involved, in particular to:synthesize information;conduct a participatory assessment of vulnerability to current variability andextreme events and of areas where risks would increase because of climatechange;identify key adaptation measures; identify and prioritize country-driven criteria for selecting priority activities;select a prioritized short list of activities and projects to address urgent andimmediate adaptation needs.The national team then develops proposals for priority activitiesin a consultativeprocess, organized nationally and/or sub-nationally.

Other areas of relevance to adaptationResearch and systematic observation (see chapter 15):the work ofthe SBSTAon global systems to observe climate is crucial in enabling Parties to applyobservations,data and products to climate impact assessments and preparationfor adaptation.It also supports the implementation ofthe five-year programmeofwork on impacts,vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.Support totheImplementation Plan for the Global Observing System for Climate in Support ofthe UNFCCCprepared by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)secretariat is consistent with actions identified in decision 5/CP.7 in relation tothe adverse effects ofclimate.In its consideration ofresearch needs andpriorities to support the implementation ofthe Convention as well as nationalefforts to cope with climate change,SBSTA 24 considered the results ofthesynthesis report on research needs and priorities relating to the Convention106.This highlights the need to stimulate research in areas not addressed by theglobal change research programmes,such as mitigation technology andplanning and measures for adaptation.Education,training and public awareness:the New Delhi work programmeon Article 6 ofthe Convention (decision 11/CP.8;see chapter 16) recognizesthat many Parties,intergovernmental organizations,NGOs and community-based organizations,as well as the private and public sectors,are alreadyworking actively to raise awareness,and increase understanding of,thecauses and impacts ofclimate change,and possible solutions.Theprogramme therefore encourages Parties and other entities to cooperate inpromoting,facilitating,developing and implementing public awarenessprogrammes on climate change and its effects at all levels.Activities thatfacilitate public access to information on climate change and its effects,andthat promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects105See <http://unfccc.int/national_reports/non-annex_i_natcom/cge/items/2885.php>.106See FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.2.',\n",

Those particularly\\nat risk include glaciers, coral reefs and atolls, mangroves, boreal and tropical forests, polar and alpine\\necosystems, prairie wetlands, and remnant native grasslands.\\nHuman systems too are sensitive to climate change, and those vulnerable include: water resources;\\nagriculture and food security; forestry; coastal zones and fisheries; settlements; energy and industry;\\ninsurance and other financial services; and health.\\nAdaptation is defined by the IPCC as the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or\\nexpected climatic stimuli or their effects that moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Various\\ntypes of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and public\\nadaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.\\nAdaptation policy is defined by the IPCC as action taken by governments including legislation, regulations\\nand incentives to mandate or facilitate changes in socio-economic systems aimed at reducing vulnerability\\nto climate change, including climate variability and extremes.

It ultimately led to the adoption of the Buenos\\nAires programme of work on adaptation and response measures (decision\\n1/CP.10) at COP 10 in 2004.\\n\\nRegarding the adverse effects of climate change, COP 10 decided to further\\nthe implementation of decision 5/CP.7 through actions including:\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\nimproving the collection, analysis and dissemination of information, by, for\\nexample, improving systematic observation and monitoring networks in\\nconnection with the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS; see\\nchapter 15), through increased data sharing between Parties and by\\nstrengthening in-country capacity-building;\\ncontinuing training in specialized fields relevant to adaptation;\\ndeveloping and strengthening region-specific and country-specific\\nmodelling tools to assess climate change and its impacts;\\nstrengthening institutions and centres through targeted research\\nprogrammes to address the adverse effects of climate change in\\nvulnerable sectors;\\ncontinuing to support education, training and public awareness on climate\\nchange issues and to assist participation by stakeholders;\\ncarrying out pilot and demonstration projects for adaptation to climate\\nchange;\\nfurther improving technical training for integrated impact and vulnerability\\nassessments, and for environmental management;\\npromoting urgently the transfer of adaptation technologies in priority\\nsectors such as agriculture and water resources;\\ncontinuing to build capacity to prevent and react to disasters related to\\nclimate change, such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.\\n\\nCOP 10 asked the GEF to report to subsequent COP sessions on how these\\nactivities had been supported, and on barriers, obstacles and opportunities that\\nhad emerged from its various programmes and funds.\\n\\nIn  addition, COP  10  encouraged  the  IPCC  (see  Chapter  4)  to  incorporate\\nregion-specific modelling information on the adverse effects of climate change\\n\\n71 FCCC/SB/2003/1 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sb/01.pdf> and\\n<http://unfccc.int/meetings/workshops/other_meetings/items/1104.php>.\\n72 FCCC/SBI/2003/18 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sbi/18.pdf>.\\n73 FCCC/SB/2003/INF.2 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sb/inf.2.pdf>.\\n\\n96\\n\\n\\x0cAdapting to climate change\\n\\n12\\n\\ninto  its  fourth  assessment  report  (AR4). It  also  stressed  the  importance  of\\ninvolving experts from developing countries in related research and assessment\\nactivities. COP 10 asked Annex II Parties to report on progress with support\\nprogrammes  for  developing  country  Parties. It  also  encouraged  non-Annex  I\\nParties  to  report  on  their  specific  needs  and  concerns, including  gaps  in  the\\nimplementation of decision 5/CP.7.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate the exchange of information and integrated assessments\\nto  assist  in  identifying  specific  adaptation  needs  and  concerns, COP  10\\nrequested  the  secretariat  to  organize, before  COP  13  in  2007, three  regional\\nworkshops and one expert meeting for SIDS.\\n\\nThe status of the implementation of Article 4.8, decision 5/CP.7 and decision\\n1/CP.10 is to be reviewed at COP 14 (2008).\\n\\nRelevant COP decisions:\\nDecision 1/CP.10: Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and\\n\\nDecision 5/CP.7:\\n\\nDecision 12/CP.5:\\n\\nDecision 5/CP.4:\\n\\nDecision 3/CP.3:\\n\\nresponse measures\\nImplementation of Article 4, paragraph 8 and 9, of the\\nConvention (decision 3/CP.3 and Article 2, paragraph 3,\\nand Article 3, paragraph 14, of the Kyoto Protocol)\\nImplementation of Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the\\nConvention and matters relating to Article 3, paragraph\\n14, of the Kyoto Protocol\\nImplementation of Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the\\nConvention (Decision 3/CP.3 and Articles 2.3 and 3.14 of\\nthe Kyoto Protocol)\\nAnnex: Programme of work\\nImplementation of Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the\\nConvention\\n\\n12.B.2. Addressing the special needs and special situations of least\\ndeveloped countries\\nAddressing the specific needs and the special situations of LDCs has been part\\nof the overall work on implementing Articles 4.8 and 4.9, but it has also led to\\nseparate  actions. In  2001, COP  7  adopted  a  package  of decisions  on  the\\nspecific needs of LDCs. It established:\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\na separate work programme for LDCs (decision 5/CP.7);\\nan LDC Fund (decisions 5/CP.7, 7/CP.7 and 27/CP.7);\\nguidelines for preparing national adaptation programmes of action\\n(NAPAs) (decision 28/CP.7); and\\na Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG; decision 29/CP.7).\\n\\nThe  main  focus  of\\nthe  LDC  work  programme  are  the  national  adaptation\\nprogrammes of action (NAPAs), which provide a process for LDCs to identify\\npriority activities that respond to their urgent and immediate needs with regard\\nto adaptation to climate change. The rationale for NAPAs rests on the limited\\nability of LDCs to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. In order to\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nUNFCCC Handbook\\n\\naddress the urgent adaptation needs of LDCs, a new approach was needed that\\nwould focus on enhancing adaptive capacity to climate variability, which itself\\nwould help address the adverse effects of climate change.\\n\\nBesides NAPAs, the work programme also includes the following activities:\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\nstrengthening existing national climate change secretariats and/or focal\\npoints in LDCs, or establishing new ones, to enable effective\\nimplementation of the Convention;\\ntraining in negotiating skills and language to develop the capacity of LDC\\nnegotiators to participate effectively in the climate change process;\\npromoting public awareness programmes;\\nfacilitating development and transfer of technology; and\\nstrengthening the capacity of meteorological and hydrological services.\\n\\nDecision  5/CP.7  also  called  upon  Annex  II  Parties  to  support  the  work\\nprogramme, including through financial support. The LDC Fund (see chapter\\n13.C.2.b) is to support the work programme (decisions 5/CP.7 and 7/CP.7).\\n\\nTo provide advice to LDCs on preparing and implementing NAPAs, COP 7, in\\ndecision  29/CP.7, established  the  Least  Developed  Countries  Expert  Group\\n(LEG). The group is composed of 12 experts: five from African LDC Parties,\\ntwo from Asian LDC Parties, two from small island LDC Parties and three from\\nAnnex II Parties and meets twice a year. The initial mandate of the LEG ran for\\ntwo  years. In  2003, COP  9  extended  its  mandate  for  another  two  years  with\\nunchanged  terms  of reference. A  further  review  took  place  at  COP  11  in\\naccordance with decision 7/CP.9. By decision 4/CP.11, the LEG’s mandate was\\nextended for another two years with unchanged terms of reference.\\n\\nThe LEG’s mandate includes:\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\n■\\n\\nproviding technical guidance and advice on preparing and implementing\\nNAPAs;\\nadvising on capacity-building needs for preparing and implementing\\nNAPAs;\\nfacilitating the exchange of information and promoting regional synergies\\nand synergies with other environmental conventions in the context of\\nNAPAs; and\\nadvising on the mainstreaming of NAPAs into development planning by\\nintegrating them into national strategies for sustainable development.\\n\\nDuring its first two-year term (2002–2003), the LEG organized several workshops\\nto  promote  capacity-building  for  preparing  NAPAs. This  included  one  global\\nworkshop in 2002 and four regional workshops in Africa and the Asia and the\\nPacific  region  in  2003, which  were  organized  in  cooperation  with  the  United\\nNations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and other agencies74.\\n\\n74 For more information on the regional workshops, see\\n\\n<http://www.unitar.org/ccp/napaworkshops/index.htm>.\\n\\n98\\n\\n\\x0cAdapting to climate change\\n\\n12\\n\\nDecision 28/CP.7 includes guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs (see Box\\n12.2) and invites LDCs to use them according to their national circumstances.\\nThe  guidelines  were  to  be  reviewed  at  COP  8. Earlier  in  2002, the  LEG\\ndeveloped more detailed guidance for users of the NAPA guidelines in the form\\nof annotations75. COP 8 decided therefore not to review the original guidelines\\nand invited LDCs to use the LEG’s annotations (decision 9/CP.8). COP 9, which\\nwas mandated to review the guidelines further, reiterated that no revision of the\\nguidelines was necessary (decision 8/CP.9).\\n\\nThe overall status of implementation of Article 4.9 was assessed at COP 9\\nand COP 10. COP 9 noted progress in supporting the preparation of NAPAs\\nas one element of the work programme, and emphasized the need to begin\\nwork  on  the  remaining  elements76. COP  10  noted  with  appreciation  the\\nprogress  in  implementing  the  work  programme  and  in  preparing  NAPAs77,\\nbut was concerned that only one country (Mauritania) had so far completed\\nits NAPA78. Having considered the LEG report79, COP 10 asked the LEG to\\ndraw  up  possible  elements  of a  new  mandate  strengthening  its  role  as\\nsupport  to  the  implementation  of NAPAs  and  to  report  on  it  to  SBI  23\\n(November–December  2005). Furthermore, COP  10  asked  the  LEG,\\nin\\nconsultation with LDC Parties, to include in the report to SBI 23 information\\non  the  potential  technical  and  financial  difficulties  that  LDC  Parties  might\\nhave  in  implementing  NAPAs80. COP  11  then  asked  the  LEG  to  prepare  a\\nwork programme for the implementation of NAPAs81 which was welcomed\\nat  SBI  24  in  May  2006. It  also  decided  to  review  at  COP  13  the  progress,\\nneed for continuation and terms of reference of the group and to adopt a\\ndecision thereon.\\n\\nAs of mid-2006, six countries have submitted their NAPA.\\n\\nRelevant COP decisions:\\nDecision 5/CP.7:\\n\\nImplementation of Article 4, paragraph 8 and 9, of the\\nConvention (decision 3/CP.3 and Article 2, paragraph 3,\\nand Article 3, paragraph 14, of the Kyoto Protocol)\\nFunding under the Convention\\n\\nDecision 7/CP.7:\\nDecision 27/CP.7: Guidance to an entity entrusted with the operation of the\\nfinancial mechanism of the Convention, for the operation\\nof the Least Developed Countries Fund\\n\\nDecision 28/CP.7: Guidelines for the preparation of national adaptation\\n\\nprogrammes of action.\\nAnnex: Guidelines for the preparation of national\\nadaptation programmes of action\\n\\n75 FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.14 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2002/sbi/inf14.pdf>.\\n76 FCCC/CP/2003/L.7 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop9/l07.pdf>.\\n77 FCCC/CP/2004/10, paragraph 85 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop10/10.pdf>.\\n78 FCCC/CP/2004/10, Annex III. <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop10/10.pdf>.\\n79 FCCC/SBI/2004/17 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/sbi/17.pdf>.\\n80 FCCC/SBI/2005/12 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/sbi/12.pdf> and FCCC/SBI/2005/20\\n\\n<http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/sbi/20.pdf>.\\n\\n81 FCCC/SBI/2006/9 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2006/sbi/09.pdf>.\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nUNFCCC Handbook\\n\\nDecision 29/CP.7:\\n\\nDecision 8/CP.8:\\n\\nDecision 9/CP.8:\\n\\nDecision 6/CP.9:\\n\\nEstablishment of a least developed countries expert group\\nAnnex: Terms of reference of the least developed\\ncountries expert group\\nGuidance to an entity entrusted with the operation of the\\nfinancial mechanism of the Convention, for the operation\\nof the Least Developed Countries Fund\\nReview of the guidelines for the preparation of national\\nadaptation programmes of action\\nFurther Guidance for the Operation of the Least\\nDeveloped Countries Fund\\n\\nBox 12.2: Guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs\\n\\nThese guidelines (Annex to decision 29/CP.7) set out principles, propose a process\\nfor preparing NAPAs and provide a structure for the NAPA document.\\n\\nThe purpose of NAPAs is to communicate priority activities addressing the\\nurgent and immediate needs and concerns of the LDCs in relation to adaptation.\\nNAPAs should be:\\n\\n■ easy to understand;\\n■ country-driven; and\\n■ action-oriented, setting clear priorities for action.\\n\\nThe approach to preparing them is intended to be complementary, building on\\nexisting plans and programmes and including national sectoral policies. Other\\nguiding elements include:\\n\\n■ sustainable development;\\n■ gender equality;\\n■ sound environmental management; and\\n■ cost-effectiveness.\\n\\nNAPAs should be prepared in a participatory process, involving, in particular, local\\ncommunities. To this end, the guidelines suggest setting up a national NAPA team\\ncomposed of a lead agency and representatives of stakeholders, including\\ngovernment agencies and civil society. The national NAPA team will assemble a\\nbroader, multidisciplinary team to work on most of the tasks involved, in particular to:\\n\\n■ synthesize information;\\n■ conduct a participatory assessment of vulnerability to current variability and\\nextreme events and of areas where risks would increase because of climate\\nchange;\\n\\n■ identify key adaptation measures; \\n■ identify and prioritize country-driven criteria for selecting priority activities;\\n■ select a prioritized short list of activities and projects to address urgent and\\n\\nimmediate adaptation needs.\\n\\nThe national team then develops proposals for priority activities in a consultative\\nprocess, organized nationally and/or sub-nationally. The resulting NAPA document is\\nsubject to public review and revision, involving government and civil society\\nrepresentatives. After endorsement by the national government, the NAPA document\\nis made available to the public and to the UNFCCC secretariat.\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\x0cAdapting to climate change\\n\\n12\\n\\nDecision 7/CP.9:\\n\\nDecision 8/CP.9:\\n\\nExtension of the mandate of the Least Developed\\nCountries Expert Group\\nReview of the guidelines for the preparation of national\\nadaptation programmes of action\\n\\nDecision 4/CP.10: Work of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group\\nDecision 3/CP.11:\\n\\nFurther Guidance for the Operation of the Least\\nDeveloped Countries Fund\\n\\nDecision 4/CP.11: Extension of the mandate of the Least Developed\\n\\nCountries Expert Group\\n\\n12.B.3. Addressing the impact of the implementation of response\\nmeasures\\nThe impact of the implementation of response measures refers to any possible\\nadverse consequences that mitigation policies and measures adopted by Annex\\nII Parties may have on developing countries, and how to minimize such adverse\\nconsequences. It  has  been  addressed  in  parallel  to  the  adverse  effects  of\\nclimate  change  under  the  Convention.

Providing financial resources\\nThe  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF), an  entity  operating  the  financial\\nmechanism under the Convention, has been mandated to support adaptation\\nactivities  in  developing  countries. Funding  options  were  extended  by  the\\nMarrakesh Accords at COP 7 (2001) and included the establishment of three\\nnew  funds  which  all  have  a  strong  adaptation  component. While  chapter  13\\ndescribes  the  operation  of\\nthe  financial  mechanism  in  general  and  the\\nMarrakesh  funds  in  particular, this  section  more  specifically  addresses  the\\noverall approach taken in financing for adaptation.\\n\\nIn its initial guidance to the GEF (decision 11/CP.1), COP 1 (March–April 1995)\\nestablished a three-stage approach to funding adaptation to climate change.\\n\\n1. Stage I (short term): studies of possible impacts of climate change to\\nidentify particularly vulnerable countries or regions and provide policy\\noptions for adaptation and appropriate capacity-building.\\n\\nThe following two stages (for the medium to long term) were envisaged for the\\nparticularly vulnerable countries or regions identified in Stage I:\\n\\n1. Stage II: measures, including further capacity-building, which may be taken\\n\\nto prepare for adaptation, as envisaged by Article 4.1(e). This provides for the\\npreparation of plans for adaptation (see section 12.A above).\\n\\n2. Stage III: measures to facilitate adequate adaptation, including insurance,\\n\\namong others.\\n\\nThe GEF has funded Stage I studies in non-Annex I Parties, as requested by\\ndecision 11/CP.1. It has further funded some Stage II activities in accordance\\nwith decision 2/CP.4 and decision 6/CP.7. In both cases, funding was provided\\nin  the  context  of national  communications  and  therefore  on  an  “agreed  full\\ncosts” basis (see chapter 13), according to Article 4.3 of the Convention92. In\\nline  with  this  initial  approach, COP  10  (December  2004),\\nin  its  decision\\n8/CP.10, asked the GEF to expand support for drawing up adaptation strategies\\nas part of the national communication process for non-Annex I Parties.\\n\\nGuidance to the GEF provided at COP 7 (October–November 2001) included\\nthe request to provide financial resources, in particular to the least developed\\ncountry Parties and the SIDS, for “establishing pilot or demonstration projects\\nto show how adaptation planning and assessment can be practically translated\\ninto projects that will provide real benefits, and may be integrated into national\\npolicy  and  sustainable  development  planning, on  the  basis  of\\ninformation\\nprovided in national communications or in-depth national studies, … and of the\\nstaged approach” (decision 6/CP.7).\\n\\nIn response to increased requests for financing adaptation by the COP, in 2003\\nthe  GEF  adopted  a  new  strategic  priority  Piloting  an  operational  approach  to\\n\\n92 FCCC/CP/2004/6, Report of the GEF to COP 10. <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop10/06.pdf>.\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nUNFCCC Handbook\\n\\nadaptation, known as SPA, under its Trust Fund (from which the Marrakesh\\nfunds are managed separately). COP 9 asked the GEF to put the new strategic\\npriority  into  operation  as  soon  as  possible  and  report  on  it  to  the  COP\\n(decision 4/CP.9). The SPA was then endorsed by the GEF Council in May\\n2004, along with a document describing how it would be implemented93.\\n\\nIn its report to COP 10, the GEF provided the following information on steps\\ntaken  to  implement  decision  4/CP.9. The  strategic  priority  would  lead  to\\nbroad-based  results, good  practices  and  lessons  that  would  inform  the\\ninternational  community  as  it  sought  effective  ways  to  address  adaptation.\\nThe pilot approach envisaged that adaptation-related funding separate from\\nthe ongoing funding for national communications was to be increased. This\\nwould be provided on the basis of “incremental costs” rather than “full costs”,\\nin  accordance  with  the  GEF’s  general  principle. This  is  to  fund  the\\nincremental  costs  of projects  to  achieve  global  environmental  benefits, i.e.\\nthose  additional  costs  that  are  necessary  to  make  the  project  yield  global\\nbenefits in addition to national benefits (see Box 13.1 in chapter 13). Since\\nfunded  adaptation  projects  were  also  expected  to  provide  other  major\\ndevelopment  benefits, baseline  activities  would  require  funding  by\\ngovernments, NGOs, and bilateral and other sources of financing.\\n\\nUnder  the  SPA, the  GEF  foresees  funding  the  incremental  costs  of\\nthose\\nadaptation  activities  that  generate  global  environmental  benefits  as  well  as\\nthe incremental costs of selected adaptation activities that are identified as\\nhigh priorities by national communications. The SPA offers the opportunity to\\ntest  selected  adaptation  measures  in  key  vulnerable  sectors, regions,\\necosystems  and  communities. The  lessons  from  the  SPA  should  guide  and\\nassist the global community as it seeks to address the issue of adaptation in\\ndeveloping countries. Projects are to be selected on the basis of information\\ncontained in the national communications under the Convention, NAPAs, and\\nother  national  or  regional  studies. Further  clarification  on  the  eligibility\\ncriteria  for  projects  submitted  under  the  SPA  and  practical  and  operational\\nadvice to implementing agencies, executing agencies and project proponents\\ncan  be  found  in  the  GEF  document  Operational  guidelines  for  the  strategic\\npriority ‘Piloting an operational approach to adaptation’94.\\n\\nThe GEF also provides funding that indirectly addresses adaptation through\\nprojects in its focal areas other than climate change, such as biodiversity, land\\ndegradation and international waters. In order to tap opportunities to further\\nintegrate adaptation into all its focal areas, the GEF’s operational approach to\\nadaptation  emphasizes  linkages  in  all  its  other  focal  areas, with  the  aim  of\\nfully  mainstreaming  adaptation  throughout  its  portfolio.

An  indicative  target  of US$50  million  for  the  SPA  was\\nincluded in the 2003 business plan. The first medium-sized projects under the\\nSPA were approved in 2003. Activities for support under the SPA include the\\nUS$5million  adaptation  programme  of the  Small  Grants  Programme. It  is\\nexpected  to  develop  a  framework  to  respond  to  single  community-based\\nadaptation needs, identify and finance diverse community-based adaptation\\nprojects in a number of selected countries, and pass on the lessons learned\\nat the community level to all stakeholders, including governments.\\n\\nIn  the  same  report, results  from  the  overall  performance  study  of\\nthe  GEF\\nindicated  that  the  GEF  climate  change  programme  would  benefit  from  more\\ndistinct guidance on the role of adaptation in its portfolio.

Transferring technology \\nMuch work relevant to adaptation has been done in developing and transferring\\ntechnologies (see chapter 14). Following guidance by the COP and the SBSTA,\\nthe secretariat has prepared a number of reports and technical papers, mostly\\nrelated  to  technologies  for  both  mitigation  and  adaptation. Some, however,\\nfocus  specifically  on  adaptation. They  include  papers  on  Adaptation\\ntechnologies98; Coastal  adaptation  technologies99; and  Enabling  environments  for\\ntechnology transfer100.\\n\\nA seminar on developing and transferring environmentally sound technologies\\nfor adaptation to climate change101 was organized by the secretariat in 2005.\\nSBSTA  23  (November–December  2005)  considered  its  outcomes  and\\nacknowledged  its  contribution  to  broadening  understanding  on: concepts;\\nneeds  for, and  identification  and  evaluation  of, technologies  for  adaptation;\\nsharing lessons learned; and identifying promising areas of future work.

National communications\\nThe guidelines for national communications of both Annex I Parties and non-\\nAnnex I Parties (see chapter 18) require Parties to report on activities related to\\nadaptation. National  communications  from  Annex  I  Parties  are  to  contain  a\\nsection on “vulnerability assessment, climate change impacts and adaptation\\nmeasures”. Non-Annex  I  Parties  are  to  include  information  on  programmes\\ncontaining measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change in their\\n“general description of steps taken or envisaged to implement the Convention”.\\n\\n98 FCCC/TP/1997/3 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/tp/tp3.pdf>.\\n99 FCCC/TP/1999/1 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/tp/tp0199.pdf>.\\n100 FCCC/TP/2003/2 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/tp/tp0302.pdf>.\\n101 FCCC/SBSTA/2005/8 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/sbsta/eng/08.pdf>.\\n102 FCCC/TP/2006/2 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2006/tp/tp02.pdf>.\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\x0cAdapting to climate change\\n\\n12\\n\\nAll  32  third  national  communications  from  Annex  I  Parties covered  by  the\\nsecretariat’s  compilation  and  synthesis  report103 contained  scenario-based\\nassessments of climate change impacts, including data on recent projections of\\nlikely  future  climate  change. Some  Parties  reported  on  steps  related  to\\nadaptation  that  they  had  taken  within  the  national  climate  change  process,\\nincluding the allocation of additional funding to develop a policy framework.\\nSome Parties reported on initial work to identify strategic adaptation options\\nfor the coming decades. Parties also reported an increasing focus on integrated\\nassessments  to  include  economic  and  cross-sectional  analysis  of adaptation\\noptions. All Parties presented initiatives on adaptation research that were in the\\nplanning stage or the very early stages of implementation.\\n\\nAlmost all Parties referred to bilateral projects and programmes that would help\\ncountries  to  adapt  to  climate  change, but  the  quality  and  quantity  of\\ninformation  provided  was  still  variable. Projects  aimed  at  assessments  of\\nvulnerability, disaster preparedness, and response and risk management were\\ndescribed as key components of adaptation policies. Vulnerability assessment\\nand disaster preparedness were also among the fields of activity which received\\nmost support in capacity-building.\\n\\nAs  for  non-Annex  I  Parties104, all  followed  the  Convention  guidelines  for\\nreporting  on  impacts, vulnerability  and  adaptation. Although  the  information\\ncentered  on  Parties’ current  and  future  vulnerability  and  adaptation  options,\\nmeasures and strategies, it also covered the methods and approaches used in\\nassessing  vulnerability  and  adaptation;\\nlimitations  of methods  and  tools;\\nproblems and difficulties encountered; sectors studied; methods for analysing\\nand  evaluating  adaptation  needs  and  priorities  for  financial  and  technical\\nsupport; and  institutional  arrangements  and  networking. Most  of the  Parties\\nreporting  used  both  internationally  developed  methodologies  and  national\\nmodels, ranging from the use of sophisticated computer models to qualitative\\nassessments based on expert judgment and literature review.\\n\\nMost of the adaptation options covering a wide range of sectors were identified\\nusing  the  IPCC  Technical  Guidelines  for  Assessing  Climate  Change  Impacts  and\\nAdaptation to evaluate and determine the cost of specific adaptation strategies\\nand measures. Most Parties emphasized that they were already experiencing\\nstresses from climate and climate-related events and phenomena that could be\\nexacerbated by future climate change. This makes them highly vulnerable. The\\nkey  vulnerabilities  included  agriculture  and  food  security; water  resources;\\ncoastal  zones  and  marine  ecosystems;\\nterrestrial  ecosystems  (forests,\\nrangelands, etc.); human health and human settlements; fisheries; biodiversity;\\ninfrastructure; coral reefs; tourism; and energy. Many Parties also reported on\\n\\n103 FCCC/SBI/2003/7 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sbi/07.pdf> and FCCC/SBI/2003/7/Add.1\\n\\n<http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sbi/07a01.pdf>.\\n\\n104 See FCCC/SBI/2005/18 and Adds <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/sbi/eng/18.pdf>, the sixth\\n\\ncompilation and synthesis report, FCCC/SBI/2003/13 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2003/sbi/13.pdf>,\\nthe fifth compilation and synthesis report, FCCC/SBI/2002/8 and for a summary of the first four compilation\\nand synthesis reports <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2002/sbi/08.pdf>.\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nUNFCCC Handbook\\n\\nplans to incorporate or integrate climate change concerns into their planning\\nprocesses as a strategy for adaptation over the long term.\\n\\nThe Consultative Group of Experts (CGE; see chapters 2 and 19) examined the\\nassessments  of vulnerability  and  adaptation  in  the  national  communications\\nand  recommended  ways  to  improve  the  process  of reporting  on  them. The\\nresults  were  taken  into  account  in  the  new  reporting  guidelines  adopted  at \\nCOP 8 (October–November 2002), which provide flexibility for more detailed\\nreporting on vulnerability and adaptation needs (see chapter 18).\\n\\nAt its second meeting in May 2004, the CGE set up thematic areas to facilitate\\nits work, one of which focuses on assessments of vulnerability and adaptation.\\nPart  of\\nits  activities  planned  for  2006  is  to  organize  regional  hands-on\\nworkshops  to  train  experts  in  using  guidelines  to  prepare  the  second  and\\nsubsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties. One of these\\nworkshops  took  place  in  March  2006  for  the  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region105;\\nanother is scheduled for the Latin America and the Caribbean region.\\n\\n12.B.9. Other areas of relevance to adaptation\\nResearch and systematic observation (see chapter 15): the work of the SBSTA\\non  global  systems  to  observe  climate  is  crucial  in  enabling  Parties  to  apply\\nobservations, data and products to climate impact assessments and preparation\\nfor adaptation. It also supports the implementation of the five-year programme\\nof work on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. Support to\\nthe Implementation Plan for the Global Observing System for Climate in Support of\\nthe  UNFCCC prepared  by  the  Global  Climate  Observing  System  (GCOS)\\nsecretariat is consistent with actions identified in decision 5/CP.7 in relation to\\nthe  adverse  effects  of climate. In  its  consideration  of research  needs  and\\npriorities to support the implementation of the Convention as well as national\\nefforts to cope with climate change, SBSTA 24 considered the results of the\\nsynthesis report on research needs and priorities relating to the Convention106.\\nThis  highlights  the  need  to  stimulate  research  in  areas  not  addressed  by  the\\nglobal  change  research  programmes, such  as  mitigation  technology  and\\nplanning and measures for adaptation.\\n\\nEducation, training and public awareness: the New Delhi work programme\\non Article 6 of the Convention (decision 11/CP.8; see chapter 16) recognizes\\nthat  many  Parties, intergovernmental  organizations, NGOs  and  community-\\nbased  organizations, as  well  as  the  private  and  public  sectors, are  already\\nworking  actively  to  raise  awareness, and  increase  understanding  of, the\\ncauses  and  impacts  of climate  change, and  possible  solutions. The\\nprogramme  therefore  encourages  Parties  and  other  entities  to  cooperate  in\\npromoting,\\nfacilitating, developing  and  implementing  public  awareness\\nprogrammes  on  climate  change  and  its  effects  at  all  levels. Activities  that\\nfacilitate public access to information on climate change and its effects, and\\nthat promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects\\n\\n105 See <http://unfccc.int/national_reports/non-annex_i_natcom/cge/items/2885.php>.\\n106 See FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.2.\\n\\n112\\n\\n\\x0cAdapting to climate change\\n\\n12\\n\\nand  in  developing  adequate  responses  are  also  encouraged. Results  of\\nregional workshops107 organized as one of the major activities to implement\\nthe  New  Delhi  work  programme  emphasize  a  high  priority  for  training  in\\nvulnerability studies and access to information on adaptation.\\n\\nThe  frameworks  for  capacity-building in  developing  countries  and  in  EITs\\nadopted at COP 7 (decisions 2/CP.7 and 3/CP.7; see chapter 17) include issues\\nrelated to adaptation, such as capacity-building for assessing vulnerability and\\nadaptation and for implementing adaptation measures. The technical paper108\\nthat investigates the range and effectiveness of capacity-building activities in\\ndeveloping countries following decision 2/CP.7, confirms that vulnerability and\\nadaptation assessments and implementation of adaptation measures are areas\\nwhere there is a great need for capacity-building. Parties are also assisted by the\\nweb-based technology information clearing house TT:CLEAR which provides\\ninformation  methods, models, and  tools  to  assess  mitigation  and  adaptation\\noptions and strategies.\\n\\n107 See <http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/education_and_outreach/items/3143.php> for\\n\\nworkshop reports>.\\n\\n108 The range and effectiveness of capacity-building in developing countries relating to decision 2/CP.7\\n\\nFCCC/TP/2004/1 <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/tp/tp0401.pdf>.\\n\\n113\\n\\n\\x0c'"
